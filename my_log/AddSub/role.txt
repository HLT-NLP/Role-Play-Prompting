1st data
Shannon and her family use up a lot of strawberry and blueberry jelly , since they eat toast every morning . At the moment , they have a combined total of 6310 grams of jelly . If they have 4518 grams of blueberry jelly , how many grams of strawberry jelly do they have ?
To find out how many grams of strawberry jelly Shannon and her family have, we can subtract the amount of blueberry jelly from the combined total.

Combined total of jelly = 6310 grams
Blueberry jelly = 4518 grams

To find the amount of strawberry jelly, we subtract the blueberry jelly from the combined total:

Strawberry jelly = Combined total - Blueberry jelly
Strawberry jelly = 6310 grams - 4518 grams
Strawberry jelly = 1792 grams

Therefore, Shannon and her family have 1792 grams of strawberry jelly.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1792.

Melanie bought a Batman game for $ 6.95 , a strategy game for $ 7.90 , and a Superman game for $ 7.73 . Melanie already owns 4 games . How much did Melanie spend on video games ?
To find out how much Melanie spent on video games, we need to add up the prices of the games she bought. 

The price of the Batman game is $6.95, the strategy game is $7.90, and the Superman game is $7.73. 

So, the total amount spent on these three games is:
$6.95 + $7.90 + $7.73 = $22.58

Dan 's cat had kittens and 5 had spots . He gave 7 to Tim and 4 to Jason . He now has 5 kittens . How many kittens did he have to start with ?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dan initially had a certain number of kittens.
2. Out of those kittens, 5 had spots.
3. Dan gave 7 kittens to Tim and 4 kittens to Jason.
4. After giving away those kittens, Dan now has 5 kittens remaining.

To find out how many kittens Dan had to start with, we can work backwards:

Let's assume the number of kittens Dan had initially is "x."

Out of those x kittens, 5 had spots. So, the number of kittens without spots is (x - 5).

Dan gave 7 kittens to Tim and 4 kittens to Jason, which means he gave away a total of (7 + 4) = 11 kittens.

After giving away those kittens, Dan now has 5 kittens remaining. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 5) - 11 = 5

Simplifying the equation:

x - 5 - 11 = 5
x - 16 = 5

Adding 16 to both sides of the equation:

x - 16 + 16 = 5 + 16
x = 21

Therefore, Dan initially had 21 kittens.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isDan initially had 21 kittens.

To find out how many oak trees the park will have after the workers cut down the damaged ones, we need to subtract the number of trees cut down from the initial number of trees.

Initial number of oak trees = 9
Number of oak trees cut down = 2

To find the remaining number of oak trees, we subtract the number of trees cut down from the initial number:

Remaining oak trees = Initial oak trees - Oak trees cut down
Remaining oak trees = 9 - 2
Remaining oak trees = 7

Therefore, the park will have 7 oak trees when the workers are finished cutting down the damaged ones.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is7.

Molly owns the Wafting Pie Company . This morning , her employees used 816 eggs to bake pumpkin pies . If her employees used a total of 1339 eggs today , how many eggs did they use in the afternoon ?
To find out how many eggs were used in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of eggs used in the morning from the total number of eggs used today.

Total eggs used today = Eggs used in the morning + Eggs used in the afternoon

Let's denote the number of eggs used in the afternoon as 'x'.

We know that the eggs used in the morning were 816, and the total number of eggs used today was 1339.

So, we can set up the equation:

1339 = 816 + x

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's subtract 816 from both sides:

1339 - 816 = x

523 = x

Therefore, Molly's employees used 523 eggs in the afternoon.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is523.

To find out how many tons of grain the ship originally contained, we need to add the amount of spilled grain to the remaining amount.

Let's denote the original amount of grain as "x" tons.

Given that 49952 tons of grain have spilled and only 918 tons remain onboard, we can set up the following equation:

x - 49952 = 918

To solve for x, we can add 49952 to both sides of the equation:

x = 918 + 49952

x = 50870

Therefore, the ship originally contained 50870 tons of grain.

Tom purchased a Batman game for $ 13.60 , and a Superman game for $ 5.06 . Tom already owns 2 games . How much did Tom spend on video games ?
To calculate how much Tom spent on video games, we need to add up the prices of the Batman game, the Superman game, and the cost of the two games he already owns.

The cost of the Batman game is $13.60, and the cost of the Superman game is $5.06. Since Tom already owns two games, we need to consider their costs as well.

Let's assume the cost of the first game Tom owns is X dollars, and the cost of the second game is Y dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Tom spent on video games can be calculated as:

Total cost = Cost of Batman game + Cost of Superman game + Cost of first game + Cost of second game

Total cost = $13.60 + $5.06 + X + Y

Since we don't have the specific costs of the games Tom already owns, we cannot determine the exact total cost. However, if you provide the costs of the two games Tom already owns, we can calculate the total cost for you.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isTotal cost = $13.60 + $5.06 + X + Y

To find out how many roses Alyssa cut, we can subtract the initial number of roses in the vase from the final number of roses. 

Let's denote the number of roses Alyssa cut as "x". 

Initially, there were 3 roses in the vase. After Alyssa cut some roses, the total number of roses became 14. 

So, we can set up the equation:

To find the total amount of material ordered by the construction company, we need to add the weights of concrete, bricks, and stone.

Weight of concrete = 0.16666666666666666 ton
Weight of bricks = 0.16666666666666666 ton
Weight of stone = 0.5 ton

Total weight of material ordered = Weight of concrete + Weight of bricks + Weight of stone

Total weight of material ordered = 0.16666666666666666 ton + 0.16666666666666666 ton + 0.5 ton

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 6.

Total weight of material ordered = (1/6) ton + (1/6) ton + (3/6) ton

Now, we can add the fractions:

Total weight of material ordered = (1 + 1 + 3)/6 ton

Total weight of material ordered = 5/6 ton

Therefore, the construction company ordered a total of 5/6 ton of material.

To find out how much longer the green caterpillar is than the orange caterpillar, we need to subtract the length of the orange caterpillar from the length of the green caterpillar.

Length of green caterpillar: 3 inches
Length of orange caterpillar: 1.1666666666666667 inches

To subtract these lengths, we can write it as a subtraction problem:

3 inches - 1.1666666666666667 inches

To make the subtraction easier, we can align the decimal points:

3.0000000000000000 inches
- 1.1666666666666667 inches

Now, subtract each digit starting from the right:

0 - 7 (Since 0 is smaller than 7, we need to borrow from the digit to the left)
10 - 7 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3

To find out how many baseball cards Sally has now, we need to subtract the number of torn cards and the number of cards Sara bought from the initial number of cards Sally had.

Sally initially had 39 baseball cards, and 9 of them were torn. So, the number of good cards Sally had is 39 - 9 = 30.

Sara bought 24 of Sally's baseball cards, so we subtract that from the number of good cards Sally had: 30 - 24 = 6.

Therefore, Sally now has 6 baseball cards.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

Mary got fast food for lunch . Mary spent $ 1.08 on soup and $ 4.80 on a salad . Mary paid with a 20 dollar bill . What was the total of the lunch bill ?
To find the total lunch bill, we need to add the cost of the soup and the salad. 

The cost of the soup is $1.08 and the cost of the salad is $4.80. 

Adding these two amounts together, we get:

$1.08 + $4.80 = $5.88

So, the total lunch bill is $5.88.

During a canned food drive , items were sorted into bins . The drive resulted in 0.125 bin of soup , 0.125 bin of vegetables , and 0.5 bin of pasta . Altogether , how many bins would the canned food take up ?
To find the total number of bins the canned food would take up, we need to add the fractions representing each type of food.

0.125 bin of soup + 0.125 bin of vegetables + 0.5 bin of pasta

To add these fractions, we need to have a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 8.

0.125 bin of soup = 1/8 bin of soup
0.125 bin of vegetables = 1/8 bin of vegetables
0.5 bin of pasta = 4/8 bin of pasta

Now, we can add the fractions:

1/8 bin of soup + 1/8 bin of vegetables + 4/8 bin of pasta

Adding the numerators, we get:

1 + 1 + 4 = 6

So, the total number of bins the canned food would take up is 6/8 or 3/4 of a bin.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3/4 of a bin.

Jason had Pokemon cards . He gave 9 to his friends . He now has 4 Pokemon cards . How many Pokemon cards did he have to start with ?
To solve this problem, we can use a simple equation. Let's assume that Jason initially had x number of Pokemon cards.

According to the problem, Jason gave away 9 cards to his friends, so he would have x - 9 cards left.

We also know that after giving away the cards, Jason has 4 cards remaining. So we can set up the equation:

x - 9 = 4

To find the value of x, we can add 9 to both sides of the equation:

x - 9 + 9 = 4 + 9

This simplifies to:

x = 13

Therefore, Jason initially had 13 Pokemon cards.

To find the total number of pitchers of lemonade Jonah poured in all, we need to add up the amounts he served during each intermission.

First intermission: 0.25 pitcher
Second intermission: 0.4166666666666667 pitcher
Third intermission: 0.25 pitcher

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 1. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

First intermission: 0.25/1 pitcher
Second intermission: 0.4166666666666667/1 pitcher
Third intermission: 0.25/1 pitcher

Now, we can add the fractions:

0.25/1 + 0.4166666666666667/1 + 0.25/1

Adding the numerators, we get:

0.25 + 0.4166666666666667 + 0.25

Simplifying the decimals, we have:

0.25 + 0.4166666666666667 + 0.25 = 0.9166666666666667

Therefore, Jonah poured a total of approximately 0.9166666666666667 pitchers of lemonade during the school play.

Joan decided to sell all of her old books . She gathered up 33 books to sell . She sold 26 books in a yard sale . How many books does Joan now have ?
To find out how many books Joan has left after selling 26 books, we need to subtract 26 from the initial number of books she had.

Initial number of books = 33
Books sold = 26

To find the remaining books, we subtract the number of books sold from the initial number of books:

Remaining books = Initial number of books - Books sold
Remaining books = 33 - 26
Remaining books = 7

Therefore, Joan now has 7 books left after selling 26 books.

An oil pipe in the sea broke . Before engineers started to fix the pipe , 2475 gallons of oil leaked into the water . A total of 6206 gallons of oil leaked before the pipe was fixed . How many gallons of oil leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe ?
To find out how many gallons of oil leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe, we need to subtract the amount of oil leaked before they started fixing it from the total amount leaked.

Total amount of oil leaked = Amount leaked before fixing + Amount leaked while fixing

Let's denote the amount leaked while fixing as 'x'.

6206 gallons = 2475 gallons + x

To find 'x', we can subtract 2475 gallons from both sides of the equation:

6206 gallons - 2475 gallons = x

x = 3731 gallons

Therefore, 3731 gallons of oil leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3731 gallons.

To find the fraction of apartments that are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom, we need to add the fractions representing each type of apartment.

The fraction of one-bedroom apartments is 0.16666666666666666, and the fraction of two-bedroom apartments is 0.3333333333333333.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the smallest common denominator is 6.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 6, we get:
- One-bedroom apartments: 0.16666666666666666 = 1/6
- Two-bedroom apartments: 0.3333333333333333 = 2/6

Now, we can add the fractions:
1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6

Therefore, the fraction of apartments that are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom is 3/6, which can be simplified to 1/2.

So, half of the apartments in Shannon's apartment complex are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1/2.

Christina just transferred $ 69 out of her bank account . As a result , the account now has $ 26935 in it . How much money was in the account before the transfer ?
To find out how much money was in Christina's account before the transfer, we can set up an equation. Let's assume the initial amount in her account is represented by 'x'.

After the transfer, the account balance is $26,935, which is $69 less than the initial amount. We can express this as:

x - $69 = $26,935

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Adding $69 to both sides, we get:

x = $26,935 + $69

Calculating the right side of the equation:

x = $27,004

Therefore, the initial amount in Christina's account before the transfer was $27,004.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$27,004.

To find out how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we need to subtract the amount he had left over from the total amount he received for his birthday.

Total amount Benny received = $79 + 9 movie tickets

Let's assume the value of each movie ticket is $10 (just for calculation purposes).

Total amount Benny received = $79 + (9 tickets * $10)

Amount Benny spent on baseball gear = Total amount received - Amount left over
                                  = $169 - $32

When Jake had 1 cat , he needed to serve 0.5 can of cat food each day . Now that Jake has adopted a second cat , he needs to serve a total of 0.9 can each day . How much extra food is needed to feed the second cat ?
To find out how much extra food is needed to feed the second cat, we can subtract the amount of food needed for one cat from the total amount needed for both cats.

Let's denote the amount of food needed for one cat as x.

According to the problem, when Jake had 1 cat, he needed to serve 0.5 cans of cat food each day. So, we have the equation:

1 cat: 0.5 cans/day

Now that Jake has adopted a second cat, he needs to serve a total of 0.9 cans each day. So, we have the equation:

2 cats: 0.9 cans/day

To find the value of x, we can set up a proportion:

1 cat / 0.5 cans = 2 cats / 0.9 cans

Cross-multiplying, we get:

0.9 cans * 1 cat = 0.5 cans * 2 cats

0.9 cans = 1 can

Now, we can see that the amount of food needed for one cat is 0.9 cans.

To find the extra food needed for the second cat, we subtract the amount needed for one cat from the total amount needed for both cats:

Extra food = Total amount needed - Amount needed for one cat
Extra food = 0.9 cans - 0.5 cans
Extra food = 0.4 cans

Therefore, Jake needs an extra 0.4 cans of cat food each day to feed the second cat.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.4 cans.

Sam 's dog had puppies and 8 had spots . He gave 2 to his friends . He now has 6 puppies . How many puppies did he have to start with ?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Sam had a certain number of puppies.
2. Out of those puppies, 8 had spots.
3. Sam then gave 2 puppies to his friends.
4. After giving away those 2 puppies, Sam now has 6 puppies.

To find out how many puppies Sam had to start with, we can work backwards:

Starting with 6 puppies, we know that Sam gave away 2 puppies. So, if we add those 2 puppies back, we can determine the number of puppies Sam had before giving any away.

6 puppies + 2 puppies (given away) = 8 puppies

Therefore, Sam initially had 8 puppies.
