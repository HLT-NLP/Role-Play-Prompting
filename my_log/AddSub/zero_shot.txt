Karin 's science class weighed plastic rings for an experiment . They found that the orange ring weighed 0.08333333333333333 ounce , the purple ring weighed 0.3333333333333333 ounce , and the white ring weighed 0.4166666666666667 ounce . What was the total weight of the plastic rings ?
To find the total weight of the plastic rings, we need to add the weights of the orange, purple, and white rings.

Orange ring weight = 0.08333333333333333 ounce
Purple ring weight = 0.3333333333333333 ounce
White ring weight = 0.4166666666666667 ounce

Total weight = 0.08333333333333333 + 0.3333333333333333 + 0.4166666666666667
Total weight = 0.8333333333333333 ounce

At the beach , Miki and her sister both built sandcastles and then measured their heights . Miki 's sandcastle was 0.8333333333333334 foot tall and her sister 's was 0.5 foot tall . How much taller was Miki 's sandcastle than her sister 's ?
To find out how much taller Miki's sandcastle was than her sister's, we need to subtract the height of her sister's sandcastle from the height of Miki's sandcastle.

Height of Miki's sandcastle - Height of sister's sandcastle = Difference in height

0.8333333333333334 foot - 0.5 foot = Difference in height

0.3333333333333334 foot = Difference in height

Therefore, Miki's sandcastle was 0.3333333333333334 foot taller than her sister's sandcastle.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.3333333333333334

The Silvergrove Public Library used a grant to purchase 2647 books . Now the library has a total of 8582 books . How many books did the library have before the grant ?
Let's assume the library had x books before the grant.
After purchasing 2647 books, the total number of books becomes x + 2647.
Since the library now has a total of 8582 books, we can write the equation:
x + 2647 = 8582
Subtracting 2647 from both sides, we get:
x = 8582 - 2647
x = 5935
Therefore, the library had 5935 books before the grant.

Blake filled a bucket with 0.8 gallon of water . Later , he poured out 0.2 gallon of the water . How much water is in the bucket ?
To find out how much water is left in the bucket, we need to subtract the amount of water poured out from the initial amount of water.

Initial amount of water = 0.8 gallon
Amount of water poured out = 0.2 gallon

Water left in the bucket = Initial amount of water - Amount of water poured out
Water left in the bucket = 0.8 gallon - 0.2 gallon
Water left in the bucket = 0.6 gallon

Therefore, there is 0.6 gallon of water left in the bucket.

A worker at a medical lab is studying blood samples . 2 samples contained a total of 7341 blood cells . The first sample contained 4221 blood cells . How many blood cells were in the second sample ?
Let's assume the number of blood cells in the second sample is x.
The total number of blood cells in both samples is 7341.
So, the equation to represent this situation is: 4221 + x = 7341.
To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
Subtracting 4221 from both sides of the equation, we get: x = 7341 - 4221.
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get: x = 3120.
Therefore, there were 3120 blood cells in the second sample. Answer: \boxed{3120}.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3120.

The Richmond Tigers sold a total of 9570 tickets last season . If they sold 3867 tickets in the first half of the season , how many tickets did they sell in the second half ?
To find the number of tickets sold in the second half of the season, we need to subtract the number of tickets sold in the first half from the total number of tickets sold.

Number of tickets sold in the second half = Total number of tickets sold - Number of tickets sold in the first half

A truck carrying 4.1 pounds of sand travels to a construction yard and loses 2.4 pounds of sand along the way . How much sand does the truck have when it arrives at the yard ?
To find out how much sand the truck has when it arrives at the yard, we need to subtract the amount of sand lost from the initial amount of sand.

Initial amount of sand = 4.1 pounds

In Shannon 's apartment complex , 0.16666666666666666 the apartments are one-bedroom apartments and 0.3333333333333333 are two-bedroom apartments . What fraction of the apartments are either 1 - or two-bedroom apartments ?
To find the fraction of the apartments that are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom, we need to add the fractions of each type of apartment.

Fraction of one-bedroom apartments = 0.16666666666666666
Fraction of two-bedroom apartments = 0.3333333333333333

Fraction of one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments = Fraction of one-bedroom apartments + Fraction of two-bedroom apartments
= 0.16666666666666666 + 0.3333333333333333
= 0.5

Therefore, half of the apartments in Shannon's apartment complex are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments.
