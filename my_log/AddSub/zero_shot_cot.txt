1st data
Shannon and her family use up a lot of strawberry and blueberry jelly , since they eat toast every morning . At the moment , they have a combined total of 6310 grams of jelly . If they have 4518 grams of blueberry jelly , how many grams of strawberry jelly do they have ?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Find the total grams of jelly Shannon and her family have.
Total grams of jelly = 6310 grams

Step 2: Subtract the grams of blueberry jelly from the total grams of jelly to find the grams of strawberry jelly.
Grams of strawberry jelly = Total grams of jelly - Grams of blueberry jelly
Grams of strawberry jelly = 6310 grams - 4518 grams
Grams of strawberry jelly = 1792 grams

Therefore, Shannon and her family have 1792 grams of strawberry jelly.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1792.

There were a total of 8 football games this year , 4 are played at night . Keith missed 4 of the games . How many football games did Keith go to in total ?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the number of games played during the day.
Since there were a total of 8 games and 4 were played at night, the remaining 4 games must have been played during the day.

Step 2: Subtract the number of games Keith missed from the total number of games played during the day.
Keith missed 4 games, so we subtract 4 from the 4 games played during the day.

4 games played during the day - 4 games missed = 0 games Keith went to during the day.

Step 3: Add the number of games played at night to the number of games Keith went to during the day.
Since Keith did not go to any games during the day, we only need to consider the games played at night.

0 games during the day + 4 games played at night = 4 games Keith went to in total.

Therefore, Keith went to a total of 4 football games.

The Silvergrove Public Library used a grant to purchase 2647 books . Now the library has a total of 8582 books . How many books did the library have before the grant ?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume the library had x books before the grant.

Step 2: The library used a grant to purchase 2647 books, so the number of books after the grant is x + 2647.

Step 3: The total number of books after the grant is 8582, so we can write the equation x + 2647 = 8582.

Step 4: To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 2647 from both sides, we get x = 8582 - 2647.

Step 5: Evaluating the right side of the equation, we find x = 5935.

Therefore, the library had 5935 books before the grant.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total amount of grain that spilled into the water.
The ship originally contained x tons of grain.
The amount of grain that remained onboard after the spill is 918 tons.
Therefore, the amount of grain that spilled into the water is x - 918 tons.

The total amount of grain that spilled into the water is 49952 tons.
Therefore, the equation is: x - 918 = 49952.

Step 3: Solve the equation to find the original amount of grain on the ship.
x - 918 = 49952
x = 49952 + 918
x = 50870

While playing a video game , Paul scored 3103 points . He and his cousin together have a total of 5816 points . How many points does Paul 's cousin have ?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume that Paul's cousin has x points.
Step 2: We know that Paul scored 3103 points, so the total points between Paul and his cousin is 3103 + x.
Step 3: We also know that the total points between Paul and his cousin is 5816.
Step 4: Therefore, we can write the equation 3103 + x = 5816.
Step 5: To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 3103 from both sides gives us x = 5816 - 3103.
Step 6: Simplifying the equation gives us x = 2713.
Step 7: Therefore, Paul's cousin has 2713 points.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total distance Craig traveled.
To find the total distance Craig traveled, we need to add the distance he rode on the bus to the distance he walked. 

Distance rode on the bus = 3.8333333333333335 miles
Distance walked = 0.16666666666666666 mile

Total distance traveled = Distance rode on the bus + Distance walked
Total distance traveled = 3.8333333333333335 miles + 0.16666666666666666 mile

Total distance traveled = 4 miles

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the distance Craig rode and walked.
To find the difference between the distance Craig rode and walked, we need to subtract the distance he walked from the distance he rode on the bus.

Difference = Distance rode on the bus - Distance walked
Difference = 3.8333333333333335 miles - 0.16666666666666666 mile

Difference = 3.6666666666666665 miles

When Jake had 1 cat , he needed to serve 0.5 can of cat food each day . Now that Jake has adopted a second cat , he needs to serve a total of 0.9 can each day . How much extra food is needed to feed the second cat ?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine the amount of food needed for one cat.
Since Jake needed to serve 0.5 cans of cat food each day when he had one cat, we can conclude that one cat requires 0.5 cans of cat food.

Step 2: Determine the total amount of food needed for two cats.
Now that Jake has adopted a second cat, he needs to serve a total of 0.9 cans of cat food each day. Since we know that one cat requires 0.5 cans of cat food, we can subtract this amount from the total to find the extra food needed for the second cat.
0.9 cans - 0.5 cans = 0.4 cans

Step 3: Calculate the extra food needed for the second cat.
Therefore, Jake needs an extra 0.4 cans of cat food each day to feed the second cat.
