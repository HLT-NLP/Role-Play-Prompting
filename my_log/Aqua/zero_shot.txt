The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k = Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
Let $n$ be the number of integers in the sum. Then the sum of the integers is $\frac{n}{2}(-50 + (-50 + n - 1)) = \frac{n}{2}(-100 + n - 1) = \frac{n}{2}(n - 101)$. We want this to equal 51, so $\frac{n}{2}(n - 101) = 51$. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $n(n - 101) = 102$. Since $n$ is an integer, $n$ must be a factor of 102. The factors of 102 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 17, 34, 51, and 102. The only factor that is one more than a multiple of 101 is 102, so $n = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }102}$.

A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? Answer Choices: (A) 8.75 (B) 8.79 (C) 8.75 (D) 8.71 (E) 8.72
The area of the square is $20^2=400$ square cm. The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm. The area of each semicircle is $\frac{1}{2}\pi(10^2)=50\pi$ square cm. Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is $2(50\pi)=100\pi$ square cm. The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the semicircles, or $400-100\pi$ square cm. Since $\pi\approx3.14$, we have $400-100\pi\approx400-100(3.14)=400-314=86$.

The bond pays interest every six months, so it will pay interest twice over the course of the year. The interest rate is 12%, so each interest payment will be 12% of the principal. 

The first interest payment will be $5,000 * 0.12 = $<<5000*0.12=600>>600.

There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. If five registered voters are chosen at random, what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6%
We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The probability that exactly $k$ out of $n$ voters voted in the last election is given by $\binom{n}{k} \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}$, where $p$ is the probability that a registered voter voted in the last election. In this case, $p = 0.9$ and $n = 5$. So, the probability that exactly four of them voted in the last election is $\binom{5}{4} \cdot 0.9^4 \cdot (1-0.9)^{5-4} = 5 \cdot 0.9^4 \cdot 0.1 = 0.32805$. Rounding to the nearest tenth, the approximate likelihood is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }32.8\%}$.

In a row of children Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha. How many children are there in the row? Answer Choices: (A) 23 (B) 27 (C) 26 (D) 28 (E) 29
Let's first find the original positions of Neha and Radha. 

Since Neha is 12th from the left end, there are 11 children to her left. 
Similarly, since Radha is 6th from the right end, there are 5 children to her right. 

Now, let's consider the new positions of Neha and Radha after they are shifted. 

If Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, she will be at the 4th position from the right end. 
If Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, she will be at the 14th position from the left end. 

We are given that there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. 

So, the total number of children in the row is 14 (Neha's position) + 4 (Radha's position) + 6 (children between them) = 24. 

However, we need to add 1 to this total to account for Neha and Radha themselves. 

Therefore, the total number of children in the row is 24 + 1 = 25.

Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
Let's calculate the average cost per year of the new tires first. Since the new tires last for four years and cost $180 per tire, the average cost per year is $180/4 = $<<180/4=45>>45 per year.

Now let's calculate the cost per year of repairing the current tires. Since the repair costs $40 per tire and makes the tires last for one additional year, the cost per year is $40/1 = $40 per year.

To find the percent difference between the two costs, we can use the formula: (new cost - old cost) / old cost * 100%.

Plugging in the values, we get: (45 - 40) / 40 * 100% = 5 / 40 * 100% = 12.5%.

Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

Let the original selling price of each article be $x.
After the price decreased by 15%, the new selling price of each article is $x - 0.15x = $0.85x.
Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the 5 articles is $300.
Therefore, 5 * $0.85x = $300.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get $0.85x = $60.
Dividing both sides of the equation by $0.85, we get x = $70.
Therefore, the new selling price of each article is $0.85 * $70 = $59.5.

A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain? Answer Choices: (A) 80 kmph (B) 50 kmph (C) 120 kmph (D) 70 kmph (E) 80 kmph
To find the speed gained, we need to find the difference between the initial speed and the final speed. 

The initial speed is given as 60 km/hr, and the time taken is 20 hours. Therefore, the initial distance covered is 60 km/hr * 20 hr = 1200 km.

To find the final speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance/time. The distance is still 1200 km, but the time taken is now 10 hours. Therefore, the final speed is 1200 km/10 hr = 120 km/hr.

The speed gained is the difference between the final speed and the initial speed: 120 km/hr - 60 km/hr = 60 km/hr.

Therefore, the car gains a speed of 60 km/hr.

Let's assume that Q is x years younger than R and x years older than T. 

So, we can say that R = Q + x and T = Q - x. 

Given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years, we can write the equation: R + T = 50. 

Substituting the values of R and T, we get: (Q + x) + (Q - x) = 50. 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2Q = 50. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: Q = 25. 

Since we know the value of Q, we can find the difference between R and Q by substituting the value of Q in the equation R = Q + x. 

R = 25 + x. 

The difference between R and Q is given by R - Q = (25 + x) - 25 = x. 

Since we do not know the value of x, we cannot determine the exact difference between R and Q's age. 

Therefore, the answer is (D) Cannot be determined.

The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m
Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.

The perimeter of the room is 2 * (2x + 5x) = 14x.

The cost of papering the walls is equal to the cost of the paper multiplied by the length of the paper needed. The length of the paper needed is equal to the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height of the room.

The length of the paper needed is 14x * 2x = 28x^2.

The cost of the paper is 2 Rs per meter, so the cost of the papering is 2 * 28x^2 = 56x^2 Rs.

The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, so the area of the walls is the total area minus the area of the doors and windows.

The total area is 28x^2, so the area of the walls is 28x^2 - 15.

The cost of papering the walls is 260 Rs, so we have the equation:

56x^2 = 260 + 2 * (28x^2 - 15).

Simplifying the equation, we get:

56x^2 = 260 + 56x^2 - 30.

Subtracting 56x^2 from both sides, we get:

0 = 260 - 30.

Simplifying further, we get:

0 = 230.

This is a contradiction, so our assumption that the height of the room is 2x is incorrect.

Let's assume the height of the room is 5x and the semi-perimeter is 2x.

Using the same steps as above, we get the equation:

56x^2 = 260 + 2 * (28x^2 - 15).

Simplifying the equation, we get:

56x^2 = 260 + 56x^2 - 30.

Subtracting 56x^2 from both sides, we get:

0 = 260 - 30.

Simplifying further, we get:

0 = 230.

This is a contradiction, so our assumption that the height of the room is 5x is also incorrect.

A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
Let's assume that C joined the business after $x$ months.
Since A started the business with Rs.40,000 and B joined after 2 months with Rs.60,000, the ratio of their investments is $40,000 \cdot 2 : 60,000 = 4:6 = 2:3$.
Similarly, the ratio of their investments when C joined is $2:3:x$.
Since C gets Rs.150,000 as his share out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, the ratio of their shares is $2:3:x = 2:3:150,000$.
We can set up the equation $\frac{2}{2+3+x} = \frac{150,000}{375,000}$ and solve for $x$.
Cross-multiplying, we get $2(375,000) = 150,000(2+3+x)$.
Simplifying, we get $750,000 = 300,000 + 150,000x$.
Subtracting $300,000$ from both sides, we get $450,000 = 150,000x$.
Dividing both sides by $150,000$, we get $x = 3$.
Therefore, C joined the business 3 months after B joined.
Since B joined after 2 months, C joined $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }4 \text{ months}}$ after B joined.

The average speed for an activity is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. 

For the running activity, the athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, so the average speed for running is M/4 miles per hour.

For the biking activity, the athlete rides N miles in 4 hours, so the average speed for biking is N/4 miles per hour.

To find the average speed for these two activities combined, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The total distance traveled is M + N miles.

The total time taken is 4 hours for both activities.

Therefore, the average speed for these two activities combined is (M + N)/(4 + 4) = (M + N)/8 miles per hour.

All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
Let's denote the number of files infected only by a virus as $V$, the number of files infected only by a worm as $W$, and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as $B$. We are given that $V + W + B = 250$.

We are also given that the number of files infected only by a worm is $2.5$ times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. In other words, $W = 2.5B$.

We are told that $50\%$ of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that $50\%$ of the files were either not infected at all or were infected only by a worm. In other words, $W + B$ is equal to $50\%$ of the total number of files, or $\frac{1}{2}(250) = 125$.

We can now set up a system of equations to solve for $V$, $W$, and $B$:
\begin{align*}
V + W + B &= 250 \\
W &= 2.5B \\
W + B &= 125
\end{align*}

Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get $2.5B + B = 125$, which simplifies to $3.5B = 125$. Dividing both sides by $3.5$, we find that $B = \frac{125}{3.5} = 35.714$.

Since $B$ represents the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, which must be a whole number, we can conclude that $B = 36$.

Substituting this value back into the second equation, we find that $W = 2.5(36) = 90$.

Finally, substituting the values of $B$ and $W$ into the first equation, we find that $V + 90 + 36 = 250$, which simplifies to $V = 124$.

Therefore, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is $250 - (W + B) = 250 - (90 + 36) = 250 - 126 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }75}$.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is$\boxed{\textbf{(C) }75}$.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour.
On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, so he cleans 2/3 * 1/12 = 1/18 of the yacht in 1 hour.
Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do, so she cleans 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 of the yacht in 1 hour.
The remaining portion of the work is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the yacht.
Jill's rate of cleaning is 1/240 of the yacht in 1 hour, so it takes her 1 / (1/240) = 240 hours to finish the remaining work.

To find the area of a triangle, we can use the formula $\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base of the triangle and $h$ is the height. In this case, the base of the triangle is the difference between the $x$-coordinates of the two vertices on the $x$-axis, which is $a-b$.

Let the number of staplers produced on Monday be $x$. Since 10 percent of the staplers produced were defective, $0.1x$ staplers were defective. Therefore, $0.9x$ staplers were non-defective. Since 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, $0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x$ staplers were rejected. We are given that $0.018x = 72$, so $x = \frac{72}{0.018} = 4000$.

A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hr 23 min (B) 1 hr 15 min (C) 1 hr 8 min (D) 56 min (E) 55 min
Let's first find the time it takes for train M to travel from City A to the point where the two trains cross each other. Train M travels for a total of 4 hours (from 5 am to 9 am). 

Now let's find the time it takes for train N to travel from City B to the point where the two trains cross each other. Train N travels for a total of 3 hours and 30 minutes (from 7 am to 10:30 am). 

Since train M travels for 4 hours and train N travels for 3 hours and 30 minutes, the two trains cross each other 30 minutes after train N starts its journey. 

Therefore, the two trains cross each other at 7:30 am. 

To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we subtract the starting time of train N (7 am) from the time they cross each other (7:30 am). 

7:30 am - 7 am = 30 minutes. 

Therefore, the two trains cross each other after 30 minutes.

Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
Let the number of yellow golf balls be $y$. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, the number of white golf balls is also $y$. Since the store sold $80\%$ of its inventory, the number of golf balls sold is $0.8(600)=480$. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is $y$.

Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have? Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42
Let's say Arjun has $x and Sajal has $y.
According to the problem, if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
So, after giving $30, Sajal will have $2(x-30) = 2x - 60.
And Arjun will have $x - $30.
Similarly, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
So, after giving $10, Arjun will have $3(y-10) = 3y - 30.
And Sajal will have $y - $10.
Now, we can form two equations from the given information:
1) 2x - 60 = y - 10
2) 3y - 30 = x - 30
Simplifying equation 1, we get:
2x - y = 40
Simplifying equation 2, we get:
x - 3y = 0
Solving these two equations, we get:
x = 3y
Substituting this value of x in equation 1, we get:
2(3y) - y = 40
6y - y = 40
5y = 40
y = 8
Substituting this value of y in x = 3y, we get:
x = 3(8) = 24
So, Arjun has $24 and Sajal has $8.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(C) }34, 62}$.

Let the original amount of dog food in the bowl be $x$. After the first hour, $\frac{2}{3}x$ remains. After the second hour, $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2x$ remains. After the third hour, $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3x$ remains. After the fourth hour, $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4x$ remains. We are given that $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4x = \frac{x}{3}$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 81$. Thus, the dog ate $81 - \frac{x}{3} = 54$ units of dog food.

Let $x$ be the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday. The hotel buys $2x$ newspapers on Sunday. The hotel buys $x$ newspapers for the rest of the week. The hotel spends $4(2x) + 1(x) = 8x + x = 9x$ dollars on newspapers. We set up the equation $9x = 210$ and solve for $x$. Dividing both sides by $9$ gives $x = 23\frac{1}{3}$.

To choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10, we can use the combination formula $\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of objects and $k$ is the number of objects we want to choose.

In this case, we have $n=10$ and $k=2$, so the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from the basket is $\binom{10}{2}=\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!}=\frac{10!}{2!8!}=\frac{10\times9}{2\times1}=45$.

20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in.

If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
Let's assume that the bag initially contained $x$ marbles. 

After the first 20 marbles were pulled out, painted black, and put back in, the percentage of black marbles in the bag remained the same. Therefore, the number of black marbles in the bag increased by $\frac{20}{100} \cdot x = \frac{x}{5}$.

After the second 20 marbles were pulled out, 1 of which was black, the percentage of black marbles in the bag was $\frac{1}{20} \cdot 100 = 5\%$. Therefore, the number of black marbles in the bag increased by $\frac{5}{100} \cdot x = \frac{x}{20}$.

Since the number of black marbles in the bag increased by $\frac{x}{5}$ and $\frac{x}{20}$, we can set up the equation $\frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{20}$. 

Multiplying both sides of the equation by $20$ gives $4x = x$, so $x = 0$. 

Since the bag initially contained $x = 0$ marbles, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 40}$.

Let the length of the other side of the yard be $x$. We are given that the width of the yard is 100 feet, so the area of the yard is $100x$. We are also given that the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, so we can set up the equation $100x=3000$.

If we include the ball with number 3 marked on it, there are $\binom{n}{2}$ ways to select two balls from the box. If we exclude the ball with number 3 marked on it, there are $\binom{n-1}{2}$ ways to select two balls from the box. We are given that the difference between these two quantities is 45, so we have the equation $\binom{n}{2} - \binom{n-1}{2} = 45$.

Let the number be $x$. The student found the value of $\frac{7}{18}x$, but he should have found the value of $\frac{7}{8}x$. The difference between these two values is $\frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x = \frac{49}{72}x$. We are told that this difference is equal to 770, so we have the equation $\frac{49}{72}x = 770$.

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of vectors. 

Let's assume that A's home is at the origin (0,0) on a coordinate plane. 

A starts by traveling 3 km towards the south, which means A's position is now at (0, -3). 

Next, A travels 5 km towards the east, so A's position is now at (5, -3). 

Then, A travels 3 km towards the north, so A's position is now at (5, 0). 

Finally, A travels 2 km towards the west, so A's position is now at (3, 0). 

To find the distance between A's final position and the origin (home), we can use the distance formula: 

Distance = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)

Plugging in the values, we get: 

Distance = √((3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2)
Distance = √(9 + 0)
Distance = √9
Distance = 3

Therefore, A is 3 km away from home.

If P eats alone, he can finish the jar in 10 minutes. This means that in 1 minute, P can eat $\frac{1}{10}$ of the jar.

If Q eats alone, she can finish half the jar in 5 minutes. This means that in 1 minute, Q can eat $\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{10}$ of the jar.

Let's assume that each nephew receives x amount of money.

Each son receives 5x amount of money.

The total amount of money distributed is Rs 8600.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

We know that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. This means that each man can do 1 unit of work per day (x units of work divided by x men working x hours per day).

Now, let's consider y men working y hours per day in y days. Each man can do 1 unit of work per day, so y men can do y units of work per day. Since they work for y days, the total work they can complete is y * y = y^2 units.

Let $p$ be the percentage of students who passed. Then $100-p$ is the percentage of students who failed. 

The average of the passing students is $83$, so the sum of their scores is $83p$. 
The average of the failing students is $55$, so the sum of their scores is $55(100-p)$. 

The overall class average is $76$, so the sum of all the scores is $76$ times the total number of students. 

Since the sum of the passing students' scores plus the sum of the failing students' scores equals the sum of all the scores, we have the equation $83p + 55(100-p) = 76 \cdot \text{total number of students}$. 

Simplifying the equation gives $28p + 5500 - 55p = 76 \cdot \text{total number of students}$. 

Combining like terms gives $-27p + 5500 = 76 \cdot \text{total number of students}$.

To find the cost price of the book, we can use the formula:

Cost Price = Selling Price / (1 + Profit Percentage)

Given that the selling price is Rs 27.50 and the profit percentage is 10%, we can calculate the cost price:

Cost Price = 27.50 / (1 + 0.10) = 27.50 / 1.10 = Rs 25

Now, let's calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs 25.75:

Profit/Loss = Selling Price - Cost Price

Profit/Loss = 25.75 - 25 = Rs 0.75

Profit/Loss Percentage = (Profit/Loss / Cost Price) * 100

Profit/Loss Percentage = (0.75 / 25) * 100 = 3%

Therefore, the answer is (D) 3% Loss.

Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. Answer Choices: (A) 11.75 miles (B) 12.75 miles (C) 17.75 miles (D) 14.75 miles (E) 10.75 miles
Let's assume that the maximum distance you can travel is $x$ miles. 

The cost for the first quarter-mile is $3.50, and the cost for each additional quarter mile is $0.10. 

So, the cost for the first quarter-mile plus the cost for each additional quarter mile is $3.50 + 0.10(x-0.25) = $8.50. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.10x - 0.025 = 8.50 - 3.50, which is 0.10x = 5. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.10, we get x = 50. 

Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel is 50 miles. 

However, since the answer choices are given in quarter miles, we need to convert 50 miles to quarter miles. 

There are 4 quarter miles in 1 mile, so there are 4 * 50 = 200 quarter miles in 50 miles. 

Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel is 200 quarter miles. 

The answer choice that is closest to 200 quarter miles is $\boxed{\text{(C) 17.75 miles}}$.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(C) 17.75 miles}}$.

Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to find the total number of microwave ovens sold and divide it by 22.

In the first 10 months of this year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month. So, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is 20 * 10 = 200.

In the remaining 12 months of last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month. So, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the remaining 12 months is 42 * 12 = 504.

Therefore, the total number of microwave ovens sold during the entire 22-month period is 200 + 504 = 704.

The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 704 / 22 = 32.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(D) } 32}$.

The nefarious bandit Hoopsmot decides to go in with his criminal partner Smolapon to purchase a number of senators. Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to their bribery pool, and Smolapon contributes just $4,000. Their total allows them to influence 30 senators. How many senators of these can be considered Hoopsmot's? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
Let's assume that Hoopsmot's contribution is represented by x and Smolapon's contribution is represented by y. We are given that x = $16,000 and y = $4,000. 

We can set up the following equation to represent the total amount of money in the bribery pool: 

x + y = $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000

We are also given that the total number of senators influenced is 30. 

Let's assume that Hoopsmot influenced a certain number of senators, represented by a, and Smolapon influenced the remaining number of senators, represented by b. 

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of senators influenced: 

a + b = 30

Since Hoopsmot contributed $16,000 to the bribery pool, we can assume that the number of senators he influenced is directly proportional to his contribution. 

We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship: 

a/x = b/y

Substituting the given values, we have: 

a/16000 = b/4000

Cross-multiplying, we get: 

a * 4000 = b * 16000

Dividing both sides by 4000, we get: 

a = 4b

Substituting this relationship into the equation a + b = 30, we have: 

4b + b = 30

Combining like terms, we get: 

5b = 30

Dividing both sides by 5, we get: 

b = 6

Substituting this value back into the equation a = 4b, we have: 

a = 4 * 6 = 24

Therefore, Hoopsmot influenced 24 senators. 

The answer is (D) 24.

Let's assume that the bee flies by x flowers in total. Since it bypasses 0.05% of the flowers, it will bypass 0.05% of x flowers, which is 0.0005x flowers. 

We are given that the bee bypasses 8 flowers, so we can set up the equation 0.0005x = 8 to solve for x.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.0005, we get x = 8 / 0.0005 = 16000.

Therefore, the bee will fly by 16000 flowers.

The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

Let's assume the fixed component of the bill is F and the variable component is V. We can set up two equations using the given information:

1) When 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs.1800:
F + 540V = 1800

2) When 620 calls are made, the bill is Rs.2040:
F + 620V = 2040

To find the values of F and V, we can solve these two equations simultaneously.

Multiplying the first equation by 620 and the second equation by 540, we get:

620F + 540(540V) = 620(1800)
540F + 540(620V) = 540(2040)

Simplifying these equations, we have:

620F + 291600V = 1116000
540F + 334800V = 1101600

Multiplying the first equation by 540 and the second equation by 620, we get:

540(620F) + 540(291600V) = 540(1116000)
620(540F) + 620(334800V) = 620(1101600)

Simplifying these equations, we have:

334800F + 157584000V = 602640000
334800F + 206616000V = 682752000

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

206616000V - 157584000V = 682752000 - 602640000
49032000V = 80112000
V = 80112000/49032000
V = 1.63

Substituting the value of V into the first equation, we can solve for F:

F + 540(1.63) = 1800
F + 877.2 = 1800
F = 1800 - 877.2
F = 922.8

Now that we have the values of F and V, we can determine the bill for the month with 500 calls:

Bill = F + 500V
Bill = 922.8 + 500(1.63)
Bill = 922.8 + 815
Bill = 1737.8

Therefore, the bill for the month with 500 calls would be Rs.1737.8
Therefore, among A through E, the answer isNone of the given answer choices match the calculated bill of Rs.1737.8.

Let the length of the rectangular yard be $l$ and the width be $w$. We are given that $lw = 240$. We are also given that $2l + w = 10 + 2w$. Simplifying, we have $l = 10 + w$. Substituting this into the first equation, we have $(10 + w)w = 240$. Expanding, we have $w^2 + 10w - 240 = 0$. Factoring, we have $(w - 12)(w + 20) = 0$. Since $w$ cannot be negative, we have $w = 12$. Substituting this into $l = 10 + w$, we have $l = 22$. The perimeter of the yard is $2l + 2w = 2(22) + 2(12) = 44 + 24 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }66}$.

Let the cost of the appliance be $x. Since the retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, the selling price is $x + 0.4x = $1.4x. 

Since the gross profit is $20.00, we have $1.4x - x = $20.00. Simplifying the equation gives $0.4x = $20.00. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by $0.4 gives x = $50.00. 

Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for $1.4x = $1.4($50.00) = $70.00.

Let's assume that the number of friends who initially planned to go on the picnic is x. 
According to the given information, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so the total extra amount collected is 4 * (x - 4).
Since the total amount collected for eatables is Rs. 96, we can set up the equation:
96 + 4 * (x - 4) = x * 4
Simplifying this equation, we get:
96 + 4x - 16 = 4x
80 = 4x
x = 20

A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
Let's first find the volume of the coin made of aluminum and silver. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The radius of the coin is half of the diameter, so it is 15/2 = 7.5 mm. Converting this to cm, we get 7.5/10 = 0.75 cm. The height of the coin is 2 mm, which is equal to 0.2 cm. 

The volume of the coin is therefore V = π(0.75)^2(0.2) = 0.3536 cm^3.

Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to that of silver, the volume of each metal is 0.3536/2 = 0.1768 cm^3.

We are given that the weight of silver is twice that of aluminum. Let's call the weight of aluminum x grams. Then the weight of silver is 2x grams.

The density of a substance is given by the formula density = mass/volume. The density of aluminum is x/0.1768 g/cm^3, and the density of silver is 2x/0.1768 g/cm^3.

We are given that the weight of the coin is 30 grams. Since the coin is made of aluminum and silver, we can write the equation x + 2x = 30.

Combining like terms, we get 3x = 30.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 10.

Therefore, the weight of aluminum is 10 grams.

Now let's find the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum. The volume of the coin is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The radius of the coin is half of the diameter, so it is 30/2 = 15 mm. Converting this to cm, we get 15/10 = 1.5 cm. The height of the coin is 1 mm, which is equal to 0.1 cm.

The volume of the coin is therefore V = π(1.5)^2(0.1) = 0.7069 cm^3.

The density of aluminum is 10/0.1768 g/cm^3.

The weight of the coin made of pure aluminum is therefore 0.706
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is36 grams.

Let's say the man's income is $100. He spends 70% of his income, which is $70. 

If his income increases by 20%, his new income will be $120. 

To find his new expenditure, we need to find 70% of $120. 

70% of $120 is $84.

Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
Let the rate at which hose A fills the pool be $a$ pools per hour, and let the rate at which hose B fills the pool be $b$ pools per hour. Since hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, we have $8a=1$, so $a=\frac{1}{8}$.

In the first 2 hours, hose A fills $\frac{1}{8}\cdot2=\frac{1}{4}$ of the pool. In the next 3 hours, both hoses together fill the remaining $\frac{3}{4}$ of the pool. Since they fill the pool at a combined rate of $a+b=\frac{1}{8}+b$ pools per hour, we have $\left(\frac{1}{8}+b\right)\cdot3=\frac{3}{4}$, so $\frac{3}{8}+3b=\frac{3}{4}$, and $3b=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{3}{8}=\frac{3}{8}$, so $b=\frac{1}{8}$.

Therefore, hose B fills the entire pool in $\frac{1}{8}$ pools per hour, so it would take $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }8}$ hours for hose B to fill the entire pool.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is$\boxed{\textbf{(A) }8}$.

Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 23 (C) 16 (D) 18 (E) 12
Let's assume that the coin landed on heads x times. 
Since Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan each time it lands on heads, Christopher would have given a total of 2x dollars to Jonathan.
Similarly, since Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher each time it lands on tails, Jonathan would have given a total of 3(20-x) = 60-3x dollars to Christopher.
Since neither of them won or lost any amount, the total amount given by Christopher to Jonathan must be equal to the total amount given by Jonathan to Christopher.
Therefore, 2x = 60-3x
Adding 3x to both sides, we get 5x = 60
Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 12
Therefore, the coin landed on heads 12 times.

The correct answer is (C) (a + b)2. 

To solve this problem, we can simplify the expression on the left side of the equation. 

a2 - b2 can be factored as (a + b)(a - b). 

So, the expression becomes (a + b)(a - b)/(a + b)2. 

The (a + b) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving us with (a - b)/(a + b). 

To simplify further, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by (a - b), resulting in (a - b)2/(a + b)2. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) (a + b)2.

The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 28 (C) 30 (D) 53 (E) 59
Let $n$ be the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, after $n$ days, there will be $64 \cdot 2^{n/2}$ water lilies on the lake. We want to find the smallest $n$ such that $64 \cdot 2^{n/2} \geq 2^{60}$. Dividing both sides of the inequality by $64$, we have $2^{n/2} \geq 2^{60-6} = 2^{54}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have $2^{n/4} \geq 2^{27}$. Therefore, $n/4 \geq 27$, so $n \geq 108$. The smallest integer greater than or equal to $108$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 53}$.

An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x.

Answer Choices: (A)  (zy – 2x) /z (B)  (zy – 2) /z (C)  (zx – y) / (z – 2)  (D)  (zy – 2x) / (z -2)  (E)  (zy – x) / (z + 2) 
Let the highest score be h and the lowest score be l. We are given that the average of h and l is x, so we have (h + l)/2 = x. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives h + l = 2x.

We are also given that the average score for the entire class is y, so we have (h + l + s)/(z + 2) = y, where s is the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers.

Multiplying both sides by z + 2 gives h + l + s = y(z + 2).

Substituting h + l = 2x gives 2x + s = y(z + 2).

Solving for s gives s = y(z + 2) - 2x.

The average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is s/(z - 2), so substituting s gives (y(z + 2) - 2x)/(z - 2).

Therefore, the answer is (D) (zy - 2x)/(z - 2).

Let the wholesale cost be $x. 

The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost, so it is $x + 0.6x = $1.6x.

The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, so it was sold for $1.6x - 0.2($1.6x) = $1.6x - 0.32x = $1.28x.

Let the distance from Winson's home to his school be $d$ miles. Since he runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, it takes him $\frac{d}{10}$ hours to run from his home to his school. Since he walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr, it takes him $\frac{d}{5}$ hours to walk home. Since the whole journey took one hour, we have the equation $\frac{d}{10}+\frac{d}{5}=1$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 10, we have $d+2d=10$, or $3d=10$. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we have $d=\frac{10}{3}$. Since $\frac{10}{3}$ is between 3 and 4, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }3}$.

Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$. We are given that $x^2 - y^2 = 256000$ and $x + y = 1000$. Factoring the difference of squares, we have $(x+y)(x-y) = 256000$. Substituting $x+y = 1000$, we have $1000(x-y) = 256000$. Dividing both sides by $1000$, we have $x-y = 256$. Adding this equation to $x+y = 1000$, we have $2x = 1256$, so $x = 628$.

Let's assume John starts with 100 mL of 50% strong milk tea.

First, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. This means he removes 15 mL of tea and adds 15 mL of milk, resulting in a mixture of 85 mL of tea and 15 mL of milk.

Next, he replaces 10% of this resultant solution with more milk. This means he removes 8.5 mL of tea and adds 8.5 mL of milk, resulting in a mixture of 76.5 mL of tea and 23.5 mL of milk.

To find the final concentration of tea, we divide the volume of tea by the total volume of the mixture and multiply by 100%.

Final concentration of tea = (76.5 mL / 100 mL) * 100% = 76.5%

Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 76.5%, which is not one of the answer choices.

(Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
We can solve this problem using complementary counting. First, we find the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from the team, which is $\binom{8}{4}=70$. 

Next, we find the number of ways to choose 4 presenters such that the group is composed of only men or only women. There are $\binom{4}{4}=1$ ways to choose 4 men, and $\binom{4}{4}=1$ way to choose 4 women.

What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? Answer Choices: (A) 3400 (B) 1700 (C) 3440 (D) Cannot be determined (E) None of these
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

In this case, we are given that the perimeter is 340 meters. So, we can write the equation as 340 = 2(l + w).

Since we are asked to find the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot, we need to add 2 meters to both the length and width.

So, the new length and width of the rectangle will be (l + 2) and (w + 2) respectively.

The new perimeter can be calculated as 340 = 2((l + 2) + (w + 2)).

Simplifying the equation, we get 340 = 2(l + w + 4).

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get 170 = l + w + 4.

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get 166 = l + w.

Now, we can calculate the area of the rectangular plot by multiplying the length and width: Area = l * w.

Since we are asked to find the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot, the new length and width will be (l + 2) and (w + 2) respectively.

So, the new area can be calculated as: New Area = (l + 2) * (w + 2).

The cost of gardening per square meter is given as 10.

Therefore, the cost of gardening the 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot will be: Cost = New Area * Cost per square meter.

Substituting the values, we get Cost = (l + 2) * (w + 2) * 10.

Since we know that 166 = l + w, we can substitute this value in the equation to get Cost = (166 + 2) * (166 + 2) * 10.

Simplifying the equation, we get Cost = 168 * 168 * 10.

Calculating the value, we get Cost = 282,240.

Therefore, the cost of gardening the 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot will be 282,240.

None of the given answer choices match the calculated cost, so the correct answer is (E) None of these.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). 

First, we need to calculate the expression inside the brackets: [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]. 

Next, we need to calculate the expression in the denominator: [13 × 13 - 156]. 

Finally, we divide the result from the numerator by the result from the denominator and set it equal to 6. 

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Calculate the expression inside the brackets: [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7].
   Start by multiplying: ? × 19 = 19?.
   Then, add and subtract: 5 + 19? - 15 - 7 = 19? - 17.

2. Calculate the expression in the denominator: [13 × 13 - 156].
   Multiply: 13 × 13 = 169.
   Then, subtract: 169 - 156 = 13.

3. Divide the result from the numerator by the result from the denominator and set it equal to 6:
   (19? - 17) / 13 = 6.

To isolate the variable, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 13:
19? - 17 = 6 × 13.

Simplify the right side:
19? - 17 = 78.

Add 17 to both sides of the equation:
19? = 78 + 17.

Simplify the right side:
19? = 95.

Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 19 to solve for ?:
? = 95 / 19.

Simplify the right side:
? = 5.

Therefore, the value of ? is 5.

The answer is (C) 5.

8% of x are interested in Football, so the number of students interested in Football is 0.08x.
4/5 of x are interested in Cricket, so the number of students interested in Cricket is (4/5)x.
10% of x are interested in Basketball, so the number of students interested in Basketball is 0.1x.
20 students are not interested in any games.
Therefore, we have the equation: 0.08x + (4/5)x + 0.1x + 20 = x.
Combining like terms, we get: 0.98x + 20 = x.
Subtracting 0.98x from both sides, we get: 20 = 0.02x.
Dividing both sides by 0.02, we get: x = 1000.
Therefore, there are 1000 students in the class.
The answer is (E) 1000.

While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is: Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 697.50 (B) Rs. 712.50 (C) Rs. 787.50 (D) Rs. 750 (E) Rs. 780
Let's assume the marked price of the watch is x.

When the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, he earns 5% profit. So, the selling price of the watch after a 5% discount is 105% of x.

When the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, he earns 7% less profit than before. So, the selling price of the watch after a 7% discount is 105% of x minus Rs. 15.

We can set up the following equation to represent the given information:

105% of x - 7% of (105% of x) = 105% of x - Rs. 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1.05x - 0.07(1.05x) = 1.05x - 15

1.05x - 0.0735x = 1.05x - 15

0.9765x = 1.05x - 15

0.0735x = 15

x = 15 / 0.0735

x ≈ 204.08

Therefore, the marked price of the watch is approximately Rs. 204.08.

Among the answer choices, the closest option to Rs. 204.08 is Rs. 197.50 (A).

Let the monthly sale be x.
The commission earned by the servant on the monthly sale is 15% of x, which is 0.15x.
The total monthly income of the servant is the sum of his salary and commission, which is 1500 + 0.15x.
We are given that the servant wants his monthly income to be 6000.
Therefore, we have the equation 1500 + 0.15x = 6000.
Subtracting 1500 from both sides, we get 0.15x = 4500.
Dividing both sides by 0.15, we get x = 30000.
Therefore, the servant should do a monthly sale of 30000 rupees.

Let the speed of the ship be $s$ miles per hour. Then, the speed of the plane is $10s$ miles per hour. 

Let $t$ be the time it takes for the ship and plane to meet. 

Since distance = rate $\times$ time, we have that the distance the ship travels is $st$ miles, and the distance the plane travels is $10st$ miles. 

We are given that the ship travels 180 miles, so $st = 180$. 

We want to find the distance from the starting point when they meet, which is $st + 10st = 11st$. 

Substituting $st = 180$, we have $11st = 11(180) = \boxed{\textbf{(D) } 287}$.

Let the original price of the item be $x.
After a 22% discount, the price of the item is 0.78x.
After using a $20-off coupon, the price of the item is 0.78x - 20.
The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so the customer paid (0.5x + 1.90).
Since the customer paid this amount, we can set up the equation:
0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90
0.28x = 21.90
x = 78.20

The bus fare for one adult is Rs. 140. Therefore, the bus fare for one child is half of Rs. 140, which is Rs. 70.

To find the total bus fare for 4 adults, we multiply the fare for one adult by 4: Rs. 140 * 4 = Rs. 560.

To find the total bus fare for 3 children, we multiply the fare for one child by 3: Rs. 70 * 3 = Rs. 210.

Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which Answer Choices: (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y)  (B) L (x,y)  ≠ R (x,y)  (C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (E) None
To determine if it is possible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y), we can consider the possible values of [x], [y], and [x + y].

Since x and y are positive real numbers, [x] and [y] will be positive integers. [x + y] will also be a positive integer, as it is the sum of two positive integers.

On the other hand, [2x] and [2y] will be even integers, as they are the greatest integers less than or equal to 2x and 2y, respectively.

Therefore, it is impossible for L(x,y) to be equal to R(x,y), as L(x,y) will always be the sum of three positive integers, while R(x,y) will always be the sum of two even integers.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(A) } L (x,y)  = R (x,y)}$.

At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit? Answer Choices: (A) 1,879 (B) 1,875 (C) 1,876 (D) 1,872 (E) 1,800
Let's first calculate the profit Karan wants to make. 

If the sewing machine costs him Rs. 1200/- and he wants to make a 20% profit, the profit amount would be 20/100 * 1200 = Rs. 240/-.

Now, let's calculate the selling price after offering a 20% discount. 

If the selling price after the discount is x, then the selling price before the discount would be x + 20/100 * x = 1.2x.

Since the selling price after the discount is the cost price + profit, we can write the equation as:

1.2x = 1200 + 240
1.2x = 1440
x = 1440/1.2
x = 1200

Therefore, the selling price after the discount should be Rs. 1200/-.

However, we need to find the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount.

Let's assume the marked price is y. 

After offering a 20% discount, the selling price would be 0.8y.

Since the selling price after the discount is the cost price + profit, we can write the equation as:

0.8y = 1200 + 240
0.8y = 1440
y = 1440/0.8
y = 1800

Therefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800/-.

Answer Choices: (A) 126 (B) 77 (C) 88 (D) 66 (E) 54
Let's assume the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is x.
According to the given information, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)x.
So, the total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus is 6 * (4/3)x = 8x.
The total fare paid by 8 persons traveling by train is 8 * x = 8x.
The total fare paid by both groups is 8x + 8x = 16x.
Given that the total fare paid by both groups is Rs. 1512, we can set up the equation:
16x = 1512
Dividing both sides by 16, we get:
x = 94.5
Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs. 94.5.

To find the interest rate, we need to calculate the total amount repaid by the man and then subtract the borrowed amount to find the interest. 

The total amount repaid in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 is 12 * 31.50 = Rs. 378.

The interest is the difference between the total amount repaid and the borrowed amount, which is 378 - 360 = Rs. 18.

To find the interest rate, we divide the interest by the borrowed amount and multiply by 100 to get a percentage: (18/360) * 100 = 5%.

Let's assume the man's monthly income is x.

He saves 12 1/2% of his income, which is equivalent to 12.5/100 * x = 0.125x.

So, his monthly expenses are x - 0.125x = 0.875x.

We know that his monthly expenses are Rs. 3500, so 0.875x = 3500.

An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds
To find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel, we need to consider the length of the train as well. Let's assume the length of the train is L miles.

Since the train takes exactly three seconds to enter the tunnel, we can set up the equation:

1 mile / 120 miles per hour = 3 seconds

Simplifying, we find that 1 mile takes 3/120 = 1/40 hours to travel.

Since the train is traveling at a constant speed, the time it takes to pass completely through the tunnel is the same as the time it takes to travel the length of the train.

Therefore, the time it takes to pass completely through the tunnel is L/40 hours.

We know that the length of the tunnel is 1 mile, so the time it takes to pass completely through the tunnel is 1/40 hours.

To convert this to seconds, we multiply by 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute:

1/40 hours * 60 minutes per hour * 60 seconds per minute = 90 seconds.

Therefore, the correct answer is 90 seconds, which is not one of the answer choices provided.

If A can construct a wall in 40 minutes, then in one minute, A can complete $\frac{1}{40}$ of the wall. Similarly, if B can construct a wall in 45 minutes, then in one minute, B can complete $\frac{1}{45}$ of the wall. 

Working together, A and B can complete $\frac{1}{40} + \frac{1}{45}$ of the wall in one minute. To find the amount of time needed to complete the entire wall, we need to find the reciprocal of this sum. 

$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{40} + \frac{1}{45}} = \frac{1}{\frac{45+40}{1800}} = \frac{1}{\frac{85}{1800}} = \frac{1800}{85} = \frac{36 \cdot 50}{5 \cdot 17} = \frac{36 \cdot 10}{17} = \frac{360}{17} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 23 \text{ min}}$.

A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
Let the cost price of each bag of flour be $x.
The selling price of each bag of flour is $100.
The profit made on each bag of flour is 25% of the selling price, which is 0.25 * $100 = $<<0.25*100=25>>25.
The profit made on each bag of flour is also equal to the selling price minus the cost price, which is $100 - $x.
Therefore, $100 - $x = $25.
So, the cost price of each bag of flour is $100 - $25 = $<<100-25=75>>75.
The total profit made by selling all the bags of flour is $3,000.
So, the total number of bags of flour sold is $3,000 / $25 = <<3000/25=120>>120.
Therefore, the answer is (E) 40. Answer: \boxed{40}.

Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
Let's assume that the speed of the elevator is x steps/minute.

If you walk 20 steps and stop, it means that the elevator moves 20 steps in 10 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 20 steps / 10 minutes = 2 steps/minute.

If you walk 10 steps and stop, it means that the elevator moves 10 steps in 20 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 10 steps / 20 minutes = 0.5 steps/minute.

Since we have two different speeds for the elevator, we can conclude that the elevator is not moving at a constant speed. Therefore, the answer is (E) None of the above.

A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for the train to cover the first quarter of the distance and the remaining three-quarters of the distance.

The total distance is covered at a speed of 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, so the total distance is 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles.

To find the time it takes to cover the first quarter of the distance, we can use the formula distance = speed * time. Let's call the time it takes to cover the first quarter of the distance t.

So, 250 miles = 100 miles/hour * t.

Simplifying the equation, we get t = 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.

The remaining three-quarters of the distance is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles.

To find the time it takes to cover the remaining distance, we can use the formula distance = speed * time. Let's call the time it takes to cover the remaining distance t'.

So, 750 miles = 75 miles/hour * t'.

Simplifying the equation, we get t' = 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total journey duration is 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours.

The correct answer is (C) 12.5.

To find the time it takes to cycle from home to work, we can use the formula $d=rt$, where $d$ is the distance, $r$ is the rate, and $t$ is the time. Since the distance is the same for both driving and cycling, we can set up the equation $20(9)=6(t)$. Solving for $t$, we find $t=\frac{20(9)}{6}=30$. Therefore, it will take the worker $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }30}$ minutes to cycle from home to work.

Each picket is 1/2 inch wide, and there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. Therefore, the total width of each pair of pickets and the space between them is 1/2 inch + 6 inches + 1/2 inch = 7 inches.

To find the length of fence in feet, we need to convert the total width to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 7 inches is equal to 7/12 feet.

Since there are x pickets, the total length of fence is (7/12) feet per pair of pickets multiplied by x pickets, which is (7/12)x feet.

Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }13x/2}$.

Let's start by setting up some ratios. Let $p$ represent the amount of falafel in one pita bread, $r$ represent the amount of falafel in one roll, and $b$ represent the amount of falafel in one baguette. 

From the first sentence, we know that $6p = 2r$. Simplifying, we find that $3p = r$. 

From the second sentence, we know that $3r = 5b$. 

We want to find the ratio of the amount of falafel in 2 baguettes to the amount of falafel in one pita bread, or $\frac{2b}{p}$. 

We can substitute $r$ in terms of $p$ into the second equation to find that $3(3p) = 5b$. Simplifying, we find that $9p = 5b$. 

Now we can substitute $b$ in terms of $p$ into the ratio we want to find: $\frac{2(9p)}{p} = \frac{18p}{p} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }2}$.

Let's assume that Sachin played x matches in the season.
His total runs in the season would be 51x.
After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his total runs would be 51x + 78.
His batting average after the finals would be (51x + 78) / (x + 1).
According to the given information, his batting average after the finals is 54.
So, we can write the equation: (51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54.
Multiplying both sides of the equation by (x + 1), we get: 51x + 78 = 54(x + 1).
Expanding the equation, we get: 51x + 78 = 54x + 54.
Subtracting 51x from both sides of the equation, we get: 78 = 3x + 54.
Subtracting 54 from both sides of the equation, we get: 24 = 3x.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get: x = 8.
Therefore, Sachin played 8 matches in this season.

Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
Let's assume that Jack buys x white sharpeners and (18-x) brown sharpeners.
The cost of x white sharpeners would be x rupees.
The cost of (18-x) brown sharpeners would be (18-x) rupees.
According to the given information, the cost of white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the cost of brown sharpeners.
So, we can write the equation as:
x = (18-x) + 1
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 19
x = 9.5
Since the number of sharpeners cannot be in decimal, we can conclude that Jack bought 9 white sharpeners and 18-9 = 9 brown sharpeners.
Therefore, the answer is (B) 9,8.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(B) 9,8

If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? Answer Choices: (A) $7.73 (B) $6.73 (C) $5.73 (D) $4.73 (E) $3.73
Let the cover price per issue be $x.
Since the subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, the cost per issue is $42.00/15 = $2.80.
Since the subscription represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, the cost per issue is 75 percent of the cover price, or 0.75x.
Setting up the equation, we have 0.75x = $2.80.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75, we get x = $2.80/0.75 = $3.73.
Therefore, the cover price per issue is $3.73, which corresponds to answer choice (E).

If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is: Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 6 kmph (C) 12 kmph (D) 14 kmph (E) 6 kmph
Let the rate of the current be x kmph. 

When the man rows against the current, his effective speed is 4 - x kmph. 
When the man rows with the current, his effective speed is 4 + x kmph. 

We are given that the man's rate against the current is 2 kmph. 
So, we have the equation 4 - x = 2. 
Solving for x, we find x = 2. 

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is 4 + x = 4 + 2 = 6 kmph.

875 &\equiv 100a + 10b + c \equiv a + b + c \pmod{abc}.
\end{align*} Subtracting these congruences, we get $2272 - 875 \equiv 0 \pmod{abc}$, or $1397 \equiv 0 \pmod{abc}$. Since $1397$ is prime, the only possible values of $abc$ are $1$, $17$, $23$, $67$, and $1397$. Checking each of these values, we find that only $abc = \boxed{1397}$ satisfies the given conditions.

There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well? Answer Choices: (A) 25 days (B) 26 days (C) 27 days (D) 28 days (E) 29 days
Each day, the frog jumps 3m up and falls back 2m down, so it makes a net progress of 3m - 2m = 1m per day.
To come out of the well, the frog needs to make a net progress of 30m, so it will take 30m / 1m = <<30/1=30>>30 days.
However, on the 30th day, the frog will jump 3m up but will not fall back down, as it will already be out of the well.
Therefore, it will take the frog 30 - 1 = <<30-1=29>>29 days to come out of the well.

Let the cost price of the article be x.
The profit made on selling the article is 20% of x, which is 0.2x.
The selling price of the article is the cost price plus the profit, which is x + 0.2x = 1.2x.
We are given that the selling price is Rs.360, so we can write the equation 1.2x = 360.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2, we get x = 360/1.2 = 300.
Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

Let the distance between X and Y be d km.
When Allen starts from X and Bob starts from Y, they meet after traveling a total distance of d km.
Since Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78 kmph, the time taken for them to meet is the same.
Let the time taken for them to meet be t hours.
Therefore, Allen travels a distance of 54t km and Bob travels a distance of 78t km.
When Allen reaches Y, he changes his direction and returns to X. This means he travels a total distance of 2d km.
Similarly, when Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. This means he travels a total distance of 2d km.
By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen.
Therefore, 78t - 54t = 48
24t = 48
t = 2
Substituting t = 2 into the equations for Allen and Bob's distances, we get:
Allen's distance = 54 * 2 = 108 km
Bob's distance = 78 * 2 = 156 km
By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen.
Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 108 + 48 = 156 km.

To find the total discount at the retailer, we need to calculate the combined discount from the manufacturer and the additional discount offered by the retailer.

The manufacturer is offering a 20% discount on the price of the tubeless tyres. This means that the customer will pay 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.

The retailer is offering an additional 20% discount on the price. This means that the customer will pay 80% - 20% = 60% of the original price.

Therefore, the total discount available at the retailer is 100% - 60% = 40%.

Let the monthly sales be $x.
The monthly salary is $500 + 5% of x, or $500 + 0.05x.
We want this to equal $1500, so we have the equation $500 + 0.05x = $1500.
Subtracting $500 from both sides gives 0.05x = $1000.
Dividing both sides by 0.05 gives x = $20000.

The liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. Therefore, in 1 second, the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons. In 60 seconds (1 minute), the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of 60(w/25) = 12w/5 gallons. 

To find how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain, we can set up the following proportion:

12w/5 gallons = y gallons / t minutes

where t is the number of minutes it will take. 

Cross multiplying, we get:

12w * t = 5y

Dividing both sides by 12w, we get:

t = 5y / (12w)

At an election meeting 10 speakers are to address the meeting. The only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak the pm should speak before the mp and the mp should speak before the mla. In how many ways can the meeting be held? Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
To solve this problem, we can break it down into three steps:

Step 1: Choose the order in which the PM, MP, and MLA speak.
Since the PM must speak before the MP and the MP must speak before the MLA, there are only 3 possible orders: PM-MP-MLA, MP-PM-MLA, and MP-MLA-PM.

Step 2: Arrange the remaining 7 speakers.
After the PM, MP, and MLA have spoken, there are 7 remaining speakers to be arranged. This can be done in 7! (7 factorial) ways.

Step 3: Multiply the results from Step 1 and Step 2.
Since the order in which the PM, MP, and MLA speak is independent of the arrangement of the remaining speakers, we can multiply the results from Step 1 and Step 2 to get the total number of ways the meeting can be held.

Total number of ways = 3 * 7! = 3 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 3 * 7!

Let's assume the initial speed of the jeep is x km/hr.
During the forward journey, the jeep takes 6 hours to travel a certain distance, so the distance is 6x km.
During the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr, so the speed becomes (x+12) km/hr.
The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours, so the distance is 4(x+12) km.
Since the forward and return journeys cover the same distance, we can set up the equation:
6x = 4(x+12)
6x = 4x + 48
2x = 48
x = 24
Substituting x = 24 into the equation for the distance of the forward journey, we get:
6x = 6(24) = 144 km
Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km.

If 8 men can complete the work in 6 days, then the total man-days required to complete the work is 8 * 6 = 48 man-days.
To complete the same work in 1/2 day, we need to divide the total man-days by 1/2, which is equivalent to multiplying by 2.

We can rewrite $M$ as $100a+10b+c$ and $N$ as $100c+10b+a$. We are given that $M-N+396c=990$, so $100a+10b+c-(100c+10b+a)+396c=990$. Simplifying, we have $99a-99c+397c=990$, or $99(a-c)+397c=990$. Since $99(a-c)$ is divisible by $99$, $397c$ must also be divisible by $99$. The prime factorization of $397$ is $397=17\cdot 23$, so $c$ must be divisible by $17$ and $23$. The only two-digit numbers that are divisible by both $17$ and $23$ are $34, 51, 68, 85$. Since $c$ is the hundreds digit, $c$ can be $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,$ or $9$. Therefore, there are $10$ possible values of $c$. Since $a$ can be any digit from $0$ to $9$, there are $10$ possible values of $a$. Therefore, there are $10\cdot 10=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }40}$ possible values of $M$ that are greater than $300$.

Let the three-digit number be $\underline{abc}$. We are given that $a+b+c=17$, $a^2+b^2+c^2=109$, and $100a+10b+c-495=100c+10b+a$. Simplifying the last equation gives $99a-99c=594$, or $a-c=6$. We can now solve for $a$ and $c$ in terms of $b$. Since $a+b+c=17$, $a=17-b-c$. Substituting this into $a-c=6$ gives $17-b-c-c=6$, or $b+2c=11$. We can now test the answer choices.

Let's assume Joe's age is $j$, his sister's age is $s$, and his father's age is $f$. We are given that $j + s + f = 100$.

We are also given that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This can be written as $j + f = 2s$. 

Finally, we are given that when Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This can be written as $j + f = 2(f - s)$. 

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $j$, $s$, and $f$. 

From the first equation, we can express $f$ in terms of $j$ and $s$: $f = 100 - j - s$. 

Substituting this expression for $f$ into the second equation, we get $j + (100 - j - s) = 2s$. Simplifying, we have $100 - s = 3s$, so $4s = 100$ and $s = 25$. 

Substituting $s = 25$ into the expression for $f$, we have $f = 100 - j - 25 = 75 - j$. 

Substituting these values of $s$ and $f$ into the third equation, we get $j + (75 - j) = 2(75 - 25)$. Simplifying, we have $75 = 100$, which is not true. 

Therefore, there is no solution to this system of equations. 

Since there is no solution, we cannot determine the age of Joe's father. The answer is $\boxed{\text{(D) 55}}$.

Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
To find the time at which both balls will be at the same starting point again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation.

Ball A takes 26 minutes to complete 2 full rotations, so it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes to complete one full rotation.
Ball B takes 35 minutes to complete 5 full rotations, so it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes to complete one full rotation.

The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes, or 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Let the other integer be $x$. We know that $\gcd(350,x)=11$ and $\operatorname{lcm}(350,x)=7700$. We can write $350=11\cdot a$ and $x=11\cdot b$ for some positive integers $a$ and $b$. We can also write $7700=11\cdot 700=350\cdot 22=11\cdot a\cdot 22$. Since $a$ is a positive integer, we have $a\cdot 22=700$, so $a=32$. Therefore, $x=11\cdot b=11\cdot 32=\boxed{352\textbf{(C)}}$.

How many ways A boy can reach the top of stairs which contain 10 steps, when he can take either one or two steps every time? Answer Choices: (A) 88 (B) 89 (C) 90 (D) 91 (E) 92
Let $f(n)$ be the number of ways to reach the $n$th step. We have the recursive formula $f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)$, since the boy can either take one step from the $(n-1)$th step or two steps from the $(n-2)$th step to reach the $n$th step. We also have the base cases $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 2$. Using these, we can compute $f(3) = 3$, $f(4) = 5$, $f(5) = 8$, and so on.

Let the length of the longer piece of rope be $x$ meters. Then the length of the shorter piece of rope is $x-3$ meters. Since the total length of the rope is 20 meters, we have the equation $x+(x-3)=20$. Simplifying the equation gives $2x-3=20$, so $2x=23$ and $x=\frac{23}{2}=11.5$.

To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

Distance traveled at 5 kmph for 6 hours = 5 kmph * 6 hrs = 30 km
Distance traveled at 4 kmph for 12 hours = 4 kmph * 12 hrs = 48 km

Total distance traveled = 30 km + 48 km = 78 km
Total time taken = 6 hrs + 12 hrs = 18 hrs

Average speed = Total distance traveled / Total time taken = 78 km / 18 hrs = 4 1/3 km/h

Therefore, the average speed is 4 1/3 km/h, which is answer choice (A).

The time it takes for the ants to meet is equal to the distance between the farms divided by the sum of their speeds. The distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B is equal to the speed of ant A multiplied by the time it takes for them to meet.

The time it takes for the ants to meet is 75 cm / (9 cm/h + 6 cm/h) = 75 cm / 15 cm/h = 5 hours.

The distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B is 9 cm/h * 5 h = 45 cm.

A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
Let's assume the cost of manufacturing each pen is x.

Since the company estimates an overall profit of 25%, the selling price of each pen would be 1.25x.

The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler at Rs. 10 each, so the total revenue from selling the pens would be 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72000.

However, 10% of the pens are defective and rejected before packing. So, the company will only be able to sell 90% of the manufactured pens.

Therefore, the total revenue from selling the pens would be 0.9 * 7200 * 1.25x = Rs. 72000.

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.9 * 1.25x = 10.

0.9 * 1.25x = 10
1.125x = 10
x = 10 / 1.125
x = 8.89

Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is approximately Rs. 8.89.

Three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again? Answer Choices: (A) After 6 minutes (B) After 12 minutes (C) After 18 minutes (D) After 24 minutes (E) none
To find the time at which the bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals. 

The prime factorization of 36 is $2^2 \cdot 3^2$. 
The prime factorization of 40 is $2^3 \cdot 5$. 
The prime factorization of 48 is $2^4 \cdot 3$. 

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime that appears in any of the factorizations. So the LCM is $2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 = 720$. 

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the bells will ring together again after $\frac{720}{60} = 12$ minutes. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(B) After 12 minutes}}$.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(B) After 12 minutes}}$.

The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is? Answer Choices: (A) 26 (B) 28 (C) 21 (D) 80 (E) 23
Let the depth of the canal be h meters.
The area of the trapezium is given by the formula: A = (1/2)(a + b)h, where a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezium.
In this case, a = 10 m and b = 6 m.
Substituting the given values into the formula, we have: 640 = (1/2)(10 + 6)h
Simplifying the equation, we get: 640 = (1/2)(16)h
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we have: 1280 = 16h
Dividing both sides of the equation by 16, we get: h = 80
Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 meters.
The correct answer is (D) 80.

Let the average weight of the 10 oarsmen be $x$. Then the total weight of the 10 oarsmen is $10x$. When the new man is added, the total weight becomes $10x+1.8$. Since the new man weighs 53 kg, the total weight becomes $10x+1.8+53=10x+54.8$. Since the average weight is increased by 1.8 kg, we have $x+1.8=\frac{10x+54.8}{11}$. Solving for $x$, we find $x=5.2$. Therefore, the weight of the new man is $10x+54.8-10x=54.8$, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }71}$.

Let's first calculate how many cakes each helper can make in 3 hours. Since each helper can make 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour, in 3 hours they can make 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 large cakes or 35 * 3 = <<35*3=105>>105 small cakes.
To make 20 large cakes, we would need 20 / 6 = <<20/6=3.33>>3.33 helpers.
To make 700 small cakes, we would need 700 / 105 = <<700/105=6.67>>6.67 helpers.
Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need 4 helpers to make the large cakes and 7 helpers to make the small cakes.
In total, we need 4 + 7 = <<4+7=11>>11 helpers.

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
Let the distance between A and B be $d$. Since Kevin drives at a constant speed of 70 mph, it takes him $\frac{d}{70}$ hours to drive from A to B. Similarly, since he drives at a constant speed of 90 mph on the return trip, it takes him $\frac{d}{90}$ hours to drive from B to A. Since he spent 3 hours approaching B, the total time for his trip is $\frac{d}{70}+\frac{d}{90}+3$ hours. We are given that $\frac{d}{70}+\frac{d}{90}+3$ is 3 hours before the end of his trip, so the total time for his trip is $\frac{d}{70}+\frac{d}{90}+6$ hours. Since his speed is constant, we can use the formula $d=rt$ to find that the total distance of his trip is $70\left(\frac{d}{70}+\frac{d}{90}+6\right)=d+\frac{9d}{7}+420$. Since the total distance of his trip is $2d$, we have $2d=d+\frac{9d}{7}+420$, so $\frac{5d}{7}=420$ and $d=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }270}$.

The outer surface of the hollow cube consists of the 6 faces of the larger cube. Each face has dimensions 5cm x 5cm, so the total area of the outer surface is 6 * (5cm * 5cm) = 150cm^2.

The inner surface of the hollow cube consists of the 6 faces of the smaller cube. Each face has dimensions 3cm x 3cm (since the thickness of the larger cube is 1cm on each side), so the total area of the inner surface is 6 * (3cm * 3cm) = 54cm^2.

Therefore, the total area of the painted faces is 150cm^2 - 54cm^2 = 96cm^2.

Each smaller cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 6 * (5cm * 5cm) = 150 faces.

Since the painted faces cover an area of 96cm^2, the remaining unpainted faces cover an area of 150cm^2 - 96cm^2 = 54cm^2.

Each face of the smaller cubes has an area of 1cm^2, so the number of unpainted faces is 54cm^2 / (1cm^2) = 54 faces.

An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field? Answer Choices: (A) 384 (B) 562 (C) 458 (D) 156 (E) 452
To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken. 

The distance traveled on each side of the square is equal to the speed multiplied by the time taken. Let's call the length of each side of the square $s$.

On the first side, the plane travels at a speed of 200 km/hr for a time of $\frac{s}{200}$ hours, so the distance traveled is $200 \cdot \frac{s}{200} = s$ km.
On the second side, the plane travels at a speed of 400 km/hr for a time of $\frac{s}{400}$ hours, so the distance traveled is $400 \cdot \frac{s}{400} = s$ km.
On the third side, the plane travels at a speed of 600 km/hr for a time of $\frac{s}{600}$ hours, so the distance traveled is $600 \cdot \frac{s}{600} = s$ km.
On the fourth side, the plane travels at a speed of 800 km/hr for a time of $\frac{s}{800}$ hours, so the distance traveled is $800 \cdot \frac{s}{800} = s$ km.

The total distance traveled is $4s$ km.

The total time taken is $\frac{s}{200} + \frac{s}{400} + \frac{s}{600} + \frac{s}{800} = \frac{8s + 4s + 2s + s}{2400} = \frac{15s}{2400} = \frac{s}{160}$ hours.

Therefore, the average speed is $\frac{4s}{\frac{s}{160}} = \frac{4s}{1} \cdot \frac{160}{s} = 640$ km/hr.

We can set up a proportion to solve this problem. Let the height of the building be $x$. We have the proportion $\frac{17.5}{40.25}=\frac{x}{28.75}$. Cross-multiplying gives $40.25x=17.5\cdot28.75$. Dividing both sides by $40.25$ gives $x=\frac{17.5\cdot28.75}{40.25}=\frac{7}{4}\cdot\frac{23}{1}=\frac{7\cdot23}{4\cdot1}=\frac{161}{4}=40.25$.

If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
Let the total number of employees be $100$. Then, $75$ employees take a winter vacation, $40$ employees take both a winter and a summer vacation, and $20$ employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. 

Since $40$ employees take both a winter and a summer vacation, $75-40=35$ employees take only a winter vacation. 

Therefore, $75-35=40$ employees take only a summer vacation. 

The percentage of employees that take only a summer vacation is $\frac{40}{100} \cdot 100 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }35\%}$.

A shopkeeper in order to promote his new shop put a discount of 20% on all the items for one day. Now he must sell the items at original price the other day. By what percentage must he increase the price to original? Answer Choices: (A) 21% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 33% (E) 18%
Let's say the original price of an item is $100. With a 20% discount, the shopkeeper sells it for $80. 

To increase the price back to the original $100, the shopkeeper needs to increase it by $20. 

To find the percentage increase, we divide the increase by the original price and multiply by 100: 

$\frac{20}{100} \times 100 = 20\%$

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 20%, which corresponds to answer choice $\boxed{\text{(B) 20\%}}$.

Let the number of boys and girls that joined the group be $x$. Since the ratio of boys to girls is $4:3$, there are $4x$ boys and $3x$ girls in the group. The total number of boys in the group is $64 + x$ and the total number of girls in the group is $40 + x$. Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, we have $64 + x = 40 + x$.

10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7
Let's start by finding the amount of sand and clay in the original mixture. 

The original mixture contains 30% sand, so the amount of sand in the mixture is 0.3 * 10kg = 3kg. 
Similarly, the amount of clay in the mixture is 0.7 * 10kg = 7kg. 

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. 

Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture. After removing x kg, we have (10kg - x) kg of the mixture left. 

The amount of sand in the remaining mixture is still 3kg, but now it represents 50% of the mixture. So, we have the equation: 

3kg = 0.5 * (10kg - x) 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

6kg = 10kg - x 

Rearranging the equation, we find: 

x = 10kg - 6kg = 4kg 

Therefore, we need to remove 4kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. 

The answer is 4kg/7kg = 4/7 = 40/7. 

So, the correct answer is (D) 40/7.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(D) 40/7

To find the number of possible combinations, we can use the formula for permutations: $P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $r$ is the number of items being arranged. In this case, $n=4$ and $r=4$, so $P(4,4) = \frac{4!}{(4-4)!} = \frac{4!}{0!} = 4! = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24$. 

Since Anna moves one book every minute, it will take her 24 minutes to go through all 24 possible combinations. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(D) } 24 \text{ minutes}}$.

We can consider the possible arrangements based on where Susan is seated. 

If Susan is seated in the leftmost chair, then Tim must be seated in the middle chair and Zen must be seated in the rightmost chair. This is the only possible arrangement in this case.

If Susan is seated in the middle chair, then Tim can be seated in either the leftmost or rightmost chair. Zen will then be seated in the remaining chair. This gives us two possible arrangements.

If Susan is seated in the rightmost chair, then Tim must be seated in the leftmost chair and Zen must be seated in the middle chair. This is the only possible arrangement in this case.

An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
Let's assume that there are 'x' employees in the organization.

If each employee contributes an equal amount, then the contribution per employee is 6 lakh / x.

If each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, then the contribution per employee becomes (6.24 lakh - 6 lakh) / x = 24000 / x.

According to the given information, the contribution per employee increased by Rs. 60.

So, we can set up the equation: 6 lakh / x + 60 = 24000 / x.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by x, we get: 6 lakh + 60x = 24000.

Rearranging the equation, we get: 60x = 24000 - 6 lakh.

Simplifying, we get: 60x = 60000.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 60, we get: x = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 employees in the organization.

Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
Let's assume that Alex and Jacob have worked for the same number of hours, denoted by x.

Since Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, he can make x/7 toys in x hours.
Similarly, Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so he can make x/9 toys in x hours.

Since both of them have worked for almost the same number of hours, we can set up the equation:
x/7 + x/9 = 35

To solve this equation, we can find a common denominator of 63:
9x/63 + 7x/63 = 35
(9x + 7x)/63 = 35
16x/63 = 35

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 63:
16x = 35 * 63
16x = 2205

Dividing both sides by 16, we find:
x = 2205/16
x ≈ 137.81

Since x represents the number of hours worked, it cannot be a decimal. Therefore, we can round x to the nearest whole number, which is 138.

Now, we can find the number of toys made by Jacob by substituting x = 138 into the equation x/9:
138/9 ≈ 15.33

Again, since the number of toys must be a whole number, we can round 15.33 to the nearest whole number, which is 15.

Therefore, Jacob has made 15 toys.

The answer is (A) 15.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(A) 15.

A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
Let the height of the tower be $h$ and the distance from the car to the base of the tower be $d$. Let $x$ be the distance the car has traveled when the angle of elevation changes from $45^\circ$ to $60^\circ$. We have the following diagram: [asy]

A=(0,0);
B=(1,0);

label("$h$",(1,0.5),E);
label("$d$",(0.5,0),S);
label("$x$",(0.5,0.5),NE);
[/asy] Using the tangent function, we have $\tan 45^\circ = \frac{h}{d+x}$ and $\tan 60^\circ = \frac{h}{d}$. Since $\tan 45^\circ = 1$ and $\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}$, we have $\frac{h}{d+x} = 1$ and $\frac{h}{d} = \sqrt{3}$. Solving for $h$ in the first equation gives $h = d+x$, so we have $\frac{d+x}{d} = \sqrt{3}$. Multiplying both sides by $d$ gives $d+x = d\sqrt{3}$. Subtracting $d$ from both sides gives $x = d(\sqrt{3}-1)$. Since the car is traveling at a uniform speed, the ratio of the distance traveled to the time taken is constant. Therefore, the ratio of $x$ to $10$ minutes is equal to the ratio of $d$ to the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower. We have $\frac{x}{10} = \frac{d}{t}$, so $t = \frac{10d}{x} = \frac{10d}{d(\sqrt{3}-1)} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3}-1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\sqrt{3}-1)(\sqrt{3}+1)} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3}+1)}{2} = \

What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
Let the weight of the heavy duty truck be x tons.
The total weight of the 10 vehicles before the truck was added is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.
After the truck was added, the total weight of the group increased to 122 + x tons.
The new average weight of the group is (122 + x) / 11 tons.
According to the problem, this new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.
Therefore, we have the equation (122 + x) / 11 = 14.8.
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 11 gives us 122 + x = 14.8 * 11.
Simplifying the right side gives us 122 + x = 162.8.
Subtracting 122 from both sides gives us x = 162.8 - 122 = 40.8.

First, we need to find the number of eligible voters. Since 20% of the 5,000 voters are not eligible to vote, the number of eligible voters is 80% of 5,000, which is 0.8 * 5,000 = 4,000 voters.
Next, we need to find the number of votes the winning candidate received. Since the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, the winning candidate received 15% of the 4,000 eligible votes, which is 0.15 * 4,000 = 600 votes.
Therefore, the total number of votes the winning candidate received is 600 votes. Answer choice (D) 2300 is incorrect.

Let's call the time it takes for Mr. Sam to go to the city by train "x" hours. 

According to the problem, it takes him 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car. So, the time it takes for him to return by car is also 17 hours. 

If he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. This means that the total time it takes for him to go both ways by train is x + (x - 4) = 17 hours. 

Simplifying this equation, we get 2x - 4 = 17. 

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 21. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 10.5. 

So, it takes Mr. Sam 10.5 hours to go to the city by train. 

If he had traveled by car in both ways, it would take him 2 * 10.5 = 21 hours.

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper.

In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify. This means that for every 7 parts of zinc, there are 11 parts of copper.

To find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z, we need to find the total amount of zinc and copper in the mixture.

In alloy X, there are 40 grams of alloy, so there are 40/5 = 8 parts of the mixture. This means that there are 8*2 = 16 parts of zinc and 8*3 = 24 parts of copper.

In alloy Y, there are 60 grams of alloy, so there are 60/18 = 10 parts of the mixture. This means that there are 10*7 = 70 parts of zinc and 10*11 = 110 parts of copper.

In alloy Z, there are a total of 16 + 70 = 86 parts of zinc and 24 + 110 = 134 parts of copper.

The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 86:134, which simplifies to 43:67.

The answer is not listed, so we need to simplify further. Dividing both parts of the ratio by 43, we get 1:1.5581. Dividing both parts of the ratio by 0.5581, we get 1.798:1, which is approximately 1.8:1.

Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$. When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is $48$, so the length of each part is $24$. When folded along the width, the perimeter of each part is $66$, so the width of each part is $33$. Thus, we have the equations $2l + 2w = 48$ and $2w + 2l = 66$. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $2l - 2w = 18$, so $l - w = 9$. Adding this equation to the first equation gives $2l = 57$, so $l = 28.5$.

We have $727+728+729=2184=2^3\cdot 3\cdot 7\cdot 13$. Since the three integers are consecutive, one of them must be divisible by $3$ and another must be divisible by $2$. Thus, the only possible values for the three integers are $725, 726, 727$ or $726, 727, 728$. In the first case, the sum is $725+726+727=2178$, which is not divisible by $13$. In the second case, the sum is $726+727+728=2181$, which is divisible by $13$. Thus, the sum of the three integers is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }39}$.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is$\boxed{\textbf{(E) }39}$.

In a class 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, 1/8 of the students study english. The total number of students is a 4 digit number. Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
To find the minimum number of students, we want to minimize the number of students studying each subject. Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, we want to minimize the number of students studying math, bio, and English. The smallest number of students studying each subject is $\frac{1}{16} \cdot 1000 = 62.5$, $\frac{1}{10} \cdot 1000 = 100$, and $\frac{1}{8} \cdot 1000 = 125$. However, since the number of students must be a whole number, the smallest number of students studying each subject is $63$, $100$, and $125$. Therefore, the minimum number of students is $63 + 100 + 125 = 288$.

To find the maximum number of students, we want to maximize the number of students studying each subject. Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, we want to maximize the number of students studying math, bio, and English. The largest number of students studying each subject is $\frac{1}{16} \cdot 9999 = 624.9375$, $\frac{1}{10} \cdot 9999 = 999.9$, and $\frac{1}{8} \cdot 9999 = 1249.875$. However, since the number of students must be a whole number, the largest number of students studying each subject is $624$, $999$, and $1249$. Therefore, the maximum number of students is $624 + 999 + 1249 = 2872$.

The difference between the maximum number of students and the minimum number of students is $2872 - 288 = \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 8870}$.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is$\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 8870}$.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
The distance traveled by a point on the edge of the fan blade is equal to the circumference of the circle that the point traces out as the fan blade rotates. 

The radius of this circle is 10 centimeters, so the circumference is $2\pi(10)=20\pi$ centimeters. 

Since the fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute, in 30 seconds it completes $\frac{300}{60}\cdot 30=150$ revolutions. 

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point in 30 seconds is $150\cdot 20\pi=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }1500\pi}$ centimeters.

In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
Let's assume the total deer population in the forest is x.
In 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned. This means that the proportion of tagged deer in the forest is 300/x.
In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, and only 20 had tags from the previous year. This means that the proportion of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is 20/500 = 1/25.
According to the given information, the proportion of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample is representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the total deer population. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
300/x = 1/25
Cross-multiplying, we get:
25 * 300 = x
x = 7500
Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500. Answer choice (E).

Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1. Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? Answer Choices: (A) 5/7 (B) 3/5 (C) 4/7 (D) 2/5 (E) 2/7
We can use complementary counting to solve this problem. We want to find the probability that a number chosen from $S$ is relatively prime to $1000$. The probability that a number chosen from $S$ is not relatively prime to $1000$ is equal to the probability that it shares a common factor with $1000$. 
The prime factorization of $1000$ is $2^3 \cdot 5^3$. A number chosen from $S$ shares a common factor with $1000$ if and only if it is divisible by $2$ or $5$. 
The probability that a number chosen from $S$ is divisible by $2$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, since every other number in $S$ is divisible by $2$. 
The probability that a number chosen from $S$ is divisible by $5$ is $\frac{1}{5}$, since every fifth number in $S$ is divisible by $5$. 
However, we have overcounted the numbers that are divisible by both $2$ and $5$, which are the numbers divisible by $10$. The probability that a number chosen from $S$ is divisible by $10$ is $\frac{1}{10}$, since every tenth number in $S$ is divisible by $10$. 
By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the probability that a number chosen from $S$ is divisible by $2$ or $5$ is $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{10} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}$. 
Therefore, the probability that a number chosen from $S$ is relatively prime to $1000$ is $1 - \frac{2}{5} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{4}{7}}$.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is$\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{4}{7}}$.

Let the first number be $n$. Then the sum of the five numbers is $n+(n+2)+(n+4)+(n+6)+(n+8)=5n+20=5(n+4)$. Since $5(n+4)$ is divisible by $10$, $n+4$ must be divisible by $2$. Therefore, $n$ must be an odd number that is $2$ less than a multiple of $2$. The only answer choice that satisfies this condition is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 41}$.

Let's assume that John has x amount of money.

According to the given information, if John gives half of his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs.75. This means that Mark will have x/2 = 75.

Similarly, if Mark gives one third of his money to John, John will have Rs.75. This means that John will have x/3 = 75.

Now, we can set up the following equation to solve for x:

x/2 = 75
x = 150

Therefore, John had Rs.150.

Among the answer choices, the closest value to Rs.150 is 28 (option C). However, none of the given answer choices match the correct answer.

Since U is the midpoint of ST, we know that RU is equal to UT. Therefore, we can find the length of RU by subtracting the length of UT from the length of ST. The length of UT is half the length of ST, so UT = 22/2 = 11. Therefore, RU = ST - UT = 22 - 11 = <<22-11=11>>11. The length of RU is 11, so the answer is $\boxed{\text{(E) }10}$.

Let the breadth of the rectangular piece be $x$. Then, the length of the rectangular piece is $4x+1$. We are given that the area of the rectangular piece is $150$, so we have the equation $x(4x+1)=150$. Expanding the left side of the equation gives $4x^2+x=150$. Rearranging the equation gives $4x^2+x-150=0$. Factoring the quadratic gives $(4x-15)(x+10)=0$. Since the breadth cannot be negative, we have $4x-15=0$, so $x=\frac{15}{4}$. The perimeter of the rectangular piece is $2(4x+1)+2x=10x+2=10\left(\frac{15}{4}\right)+2=37.5+2=39.5$. The closest answer choice to $39.5$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }63 \text{ m}}$.

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
Let the worker's wage on the 8th day be $x.
The total wages for the first 7 days is $87 * 7 = $<<87*7=609>>609.
The total wages for the last 7 days is $92 * 7 = $<<92*7=644>>644.

If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs, then what is Ajay's present age? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 60 (C) 70 (D) 80 (E) 90
Let's work through the information given step by step:

1. If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age and the remainder is divided by 18, we get Rahul's present age.
Let's say Ajay's present age is A. So, (A - 6) / 18 = Rahul's age.

2. Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years.
Let's say Denis's age is D. So, Rahul's age is D - 2.

3. We know that Denis's age is 5 years.
So, D = 5.

Now, let's substitute the values we know into the equations:

(A - 6) / 18 = D - 2
(A - 6) / 18 = 5 - 2
(A - 6) / 18 = 3
A - 6 = 3 * 18
A - 6 = 54
A = 54 + 6
A = 60

Therefore, Ajay's present age is 60.

Let's assume the number is x.
According to the given information, we can write the equation:
(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x
To solve this equation, we can first multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fractions:
2x - 30 = 120 + x
Next, we can subtract x from both sides:
2x - x - 30 = 120
Simplifying, we have:
x - 30 = 120
Adding 30 to both sides:
x = 150
Therefore, the number is 150.
The correct answer is (C) 150.

John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
To solve this problem, we can break it down into three steps:

Step 1: Choose the middle vowel
There are 5 vowels to choose from, so there are 5 options for the middle letter.

Step 2: Choose the first consonant
Since the first letter must be a consonant and different from the third letter, there are 19 consonants to choose from (since there are 20 consonants in total, but one is already chosen for the third letter). Therefore, there are 19 options for the first letter.

Step 3: Choose the third consonant
Since the third letter must be a consonant and different from the first letter, there are 18 consonants to choose from (since there are 20 consonants in total, but two are already chosen for the first and third letters). Therefore, there are 18 options for the third letter.

To find the total number of codes, we multiply the number of options for each step together:
Total number of codes = 5 options for the middle vowel * 19 options for the first consonant * 18 options for the third consonant
Total number of codes = 5 * 19 * 18
Total number of codes = 1,710

Therefore, the answer is (E) 1,900.

Let's assume the man buys x trousers and y shirts. 

According to the given information, the cost of each trouser is Rs 70 and the cost of each shirt is Rs 30. 

So, the total cost of trousers will be 70x and the total cost of shirts will be 30y. 

We know that the man spends a total of Rs 810, so we can write the equation: 

70x + 30y = 810 

To find the maximum number of trousers purchased, we need to find the maximum value of x. 

To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10: 

7x + 3y = 81 

Now, let's try different values of x to see which one gives us the maximum value. 

If we let x = 10, then 7(10) + 3y = 81 
70 + 3y = 81 
3y = 11 
y = 11/3 

Since y is not a whole number, this is not a valid solution. 

If we let x = 9, then 7(9) + 3y = 81 
63 + 3y = 81 
3y = 18 
y = 6 

This is a valid solution, so the maximum number of trousers purchased is 9. 

Therefore, the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. 

So, the answer is (A) 9 Trousers.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(A) 9 Trousers

A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can receive a 4% discount if the invoice is paid within 30 days, otherwise the full amount is due within n days. 

To take advantage of the discount, the merchant needs to pay within 30 days. The discounted amount would be 96% of $20,000, which is $19,200. 

The interest rate can be calculated using the formula for simple interest: 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $19,200, the time is 30 days, and the interest is $20,000 - $19,200 = $800. 

Plugging these values into the formula, we get: 

$800 = $19,200 * Rate * (30/365)

Simplifying, we find: 

Rate = $800 / ($19,200 * (30/365))
Rate = $800 / ($19,200 * 0.0822)
Rate ≈ 0.546

Converting this to a percentage, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is approximately 54.6%. 

None of the answer choices provided match this result, so the correct answer is (E) None of these.

Let the number of family members be $n$. Since the median income is $3000$, there must be at least $2$ family members earning $3000$ each. The remaining $n-2$ family members must earn a total of $9000-2(3000)=3000(n-2)$ dollars. Since the median income is $3000$, we must have $3000(n-2) \geq 3000$, or $n-2 \geq 1$. Thus, $n \geq 3$.

A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None
Let the length of the painted sides be $x$ and $y$. We have $x+y+9=37$, so $x+y=28$. The area of the rectangle is $xy$, so we want to find $xy$. We can use the fact that $(x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2$ to find $xy$. We have $(x+y)^2=28^2=784$, and $x^2+y^2=(x+y)^2-2xy=784-2xy$. We know that $x^2+y^2=37^2=1369$, so $784-2xy=1369$. Solving for $xy$, we find $xy=\boxed{126\text{ (C)}}$.

A M I D Answer Choices: (A) 9 2 0 0 (B) 9 2 0 9 (C) 9 2 0 1 (D) 9 2 0 7 (E) 9 2 2 2
To decipher the multiplication table, we need to find the values of the letters M, A, D, B, E, R, and I.

From the first row, we can see that M x A = M, which means that A must be 1 (since any number multiplied by 1 is itself).

From the second row, we can see that B x E = A, which means that B must be 1 (since any number multiplied by 1 is itself).

From the third row, we can see that M x A = D, which means that M must be 9 (since 9 x 1 = 9).

From the fourth row, we can see that R x A = E, which means that R must be 9 (since 9 x 1 = 9).

From the fifth row, we can see that A x M = I, which means that I must be 9 (since 1 x 9 = 9).

Therefore, the values of the letters are:
M = 9
A = 1
D = 9
B = 1
E = 9
R = 9
I = 9

Let's assume Ajay's age 10 years ago was x. 
According to the given information, Sachin's age 10 years ago was 2x. 
Now, we know that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, so his current age is 40 - 10 = 30 years. 
Since Sachin's age 10 years ago was 2x, we can write the equation: 
2x = 30 
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: 
x = 15 
Therefore, Ajay's age 10 years ago was x = 15. 
Now, to find Ajay's current age, we add 10 to his age 10 years ago: 
Ajay's current age = 15 + 10 = 25 
Therefore, Ajay is currently 25 years old.

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
Let the current population be $x$. In one year, the population will increase by $10\%$ to $1.1x$. In two years, the population will increase by another $10\%$ to $1.1(1.1x) = 1.21x$. We are told that this population is double the population of one year ago, so $1.21x = 2(1.1x)$. Dividing both sides by $1.1x$ gives $1.1 = 2$, which is not true.

Let's set up a proportion to solve for the value of M.

504/M = 420/800

Cross multiplying, we get:

504 * 800 = 420 * M

403,200 = 420M

To find the capacity of the tank, we need to calculate the volume of the tank. The volume of a rectangular prism (tank) is given by the formula:

Volume = length × width × height

Plugging in the given dimensions:

Volume = 8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m
       = 120 m³

Since 1 m³ is equal to 1000 liters, we can convert the volume to liters:

Volume = 120 m³ × 1000 liters/m³
       = 120,000 liters

Therefore, the capacity of the tank is 120,000 liters.

What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
To find the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to consider the time intervals between the arrival of the two trains.

The main line train starts at 5 o'clock and has a frequency of 10 minutes. This means that it arrives at the station at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, and so on.

The harbor line train starts at 5:02 A.M. and also has a frequency of 10 minutes. This means that it arrives at the station at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, and so on.

Since the main line train starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line train starts at 5:02, the main line train always arrives before the harbor line train.

Therefore, the man will always catch the first train that comes, regardless of the specific arrival times.

The probability of the man catching the first train is therefore 1, or 100%.

Let the cost of one soda be $s$ cents and the cost of one energy bar be $e$ cents. We can set up a system of equations to represent the given information:

$1s + 2e = 150$
$2s + 3e = 300$

Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get $2s + 4e = 300$. Subtracting this equation from the second equation, we get $e = 0$. Substituting this value into the first equation, we get $s = 150$.

Therefore, the cost of one soda is 150 cents and the cost of one energy bar is 0 cents. 

To find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, we multiply the cost of one soda by 6 and the cost of one energy bar by 7:

$6s + 7e = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900$

Therefore, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }900}$ cents.

If x is m percent of 4y, then we can write this as $\frac{x}{4y} = \frac{m}{100}$. To find m as a percentage of x, we want to find $\frac{m}{x} \cdot 100$. We can substitute $\frac{x}{4y} = \frac{m}{100}$ to get $\frac{m}{x} \cdot 100 = \frac{m}{\frac{x}{4y}} \cdot 100 = \frac{m}{x} \cdot \frac{x}{4y} \cdot 100 = \frac{m}{4y} \cdot 100$. We know that $\frac{m}{4y} = \frac{x}{4y} \cdot \frac{m}{x} = \frac{m}{100}$, so $\frac{m}{4y} \cdot 100 = \frac{m}{100} \cdot 100 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 50y}$.

In one day, Mr. Brown can paint $\frac{1}{6}$ of a house, Mr. Black can paint $\frac{1}{8}$ of a house, and Mr. Blue can paint $\frac{1}{12}$ of a house. 

After 8 days, Mr. Brown has painted $\frac{1}{6} \cdot 8 = \frac{4}{3}$ of a house. 

Then, Mr. Black paints for 6 days, so he paints $\frac{1}{8} \cdot 6 = \frac{3}{4}$ of a house. 

Together, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have painted $\frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{16}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{25}{12}$ of a house. 

Therefore, Mr. Blue needs to paint $\frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}$ of a house.

Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is x grams and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is y grams.

From the given information, we know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

So, 0.09x grams of vitamin E and 0.08y grams of vitamin A are obtained from 1 gram of the health food.

To obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to have:

0.09x ≥ x (minimum daily requirement of vitamin E)
0.08y ≥ y (minimum daily requirement of vitamin A)

Simplifying these inequalities, we get:
0.09x - x ≥ 0
0.08y - y ≥ 0

0.09x - 1x ≥ 0
0.08y - 1y ≥ 0

-0.91x ≥ 0
-0.92y ≥ 0

Since x and y cannot be negative, we can ignore these inequalities.

Therefore, we can conclude that 1 gram of the health food is sufficient to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is equal to half the length of the rope, which is 14/2 = 7 feet.

The area of the field is therefore A = π(7^2) = 49π sq.ft.

Since the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, it will take the cow approximately (49π) / 10 = 4.9π days to graze the whole field.

Since π is approximately equal to 3.14, the cow will take approximately 4.9 * 3.14 = 15.386 days to graze the whole field.

Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
Let Mohan's share be x. Then Sohan's share will be (5100 - x).
According to the compound interest formula, the amount received after 3 years at a rate of 4% p.a. is given by:
Amount = Principal * (1 + Rate/100)^Time
For Mohan's share:
Amount = x * (1 + 4/100)^3
For Sohan's share:
Amount = (5100 - x) * (1 + 4/100)^3
Since both amounts are equal, we can equate them:
x * (1 + 4/100)^3 = (5100 - x) * (1 + 4/100)^3
Simplifying this equation, we get:
x = (5100 - x)
2x = 5100
x = 2550
Therefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2550.

For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
Let's assume that the coin-diver brought $0 worth of copper coins and $3.40 worth of brass coins. 

Since the coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin, the number of copper coins she brought would be $0.20 multiplied by the number of copper coins. Similarly, since the coin-diver gets 25 cents for each brass coin, the number of brass coins she brought would be $0.25 multiplied by the number of brass coins.

Let's say the number of copper coins is $0.20x and the number of brass coins is $0.25y.

We know that the total value of the coins is $3.40, so we can write the equation:

$0.20x + $0.25y = $3.40

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the decimals:

20x + 25y = 340

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

4x + 5y = 68

Now, we need to find the minimum number of copper coins, which means we want to minimize the value of x. To do this, we can start by assuming x = 0 and solving for y:

4(0) + 5y = 68
0 + 5y = 68
5y = 68
y = 13.6

Since the number of coins must be a whole number, y must be an integer. The only integer value that satisfies the equation is y = 13.

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the coin-diver brought is 0, which corresponds to answer choice (E).
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(E) 0

The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4%
Let's assume the rate of interest is x%.

The formula for simple interest is: SI = (P * R * T) / 100
The formula for compound interest is: CI = P * (1 + R/100)^T - P

Given that the difference between simple interest and compound interest is Rs. 72, we can set up the equation:

CI - SI = 72

Substituting the values, we get:

5000 * (1 + x/100)^2 - 5000 * x * 2 / 100 = 72

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(1 + x/100)^2 - 2x/100 = 72/5000

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:

1 + 2x/100 + x^2/10000 - 2x/100 = 72/5000

Simplifying further, we get:

1 + x^2/10000 = 72/5000

Cross-multiplying, we get:

5000 + 50x^2 = 720000

Rearranging the equation, we get:

50x^2 = 720000 - 5000

50x^2 = 715000

Dividing both sides by 50, we get:

x^2 = 14300

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

x = √14300

x ≈ 119.66

Therefore, the rate of interest is approximately 119.66%.

None of the answer choices provided match the calculated rate of interest.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer isNone of the above.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

(272 - 32) (124 + 176) = 240 * 300 = 72,000

Next, let's simplify the expression inside the brackets:

17 x 15 - 15 = 255

Now, let's substitute the simplified expressions back into the original equation:

(72,000) / (255) = 282.35

None of the answer choices match the result of 282.35, so the correct answer is (E) None of these.

Train ‘A’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at the speed of 40 kmph. Train ‘B’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other? Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
To find the time when the two trains meet, we need to determine the distance they travel before they meet. 

Train A leaves Mumbai Central at 11 am and travels for 3 hours before Train B starts. Therefore, Train A has already traveled for 3 hours * 40 kmph = 120 km when Train B starts.

Let's assume the time when the two trains meet is t hours after Train B starts. 

In t hours, Train B travels at a speed of 72 kmph, so it covers a distance of 72t km.

At the time of the meeting, the total distance covered by both trains is 120 km + 72t km.

Since both trains are traveling towards each other, their combined speed is 40 kmph + 72 kmph = 112 kmph.

Using the formula distance = speed * time, we can write the equation:

120 km + 72t km = 112 kmph * t hours

120 km + 72t km = 112t km

120 km = 40t km

t = 120 km / 40 kmph

t = 3 hours

Therefore, the two trains will meet 3 hours after Train B starts, which is at 2 pm + 3 hours = 5 pm.

The correct answer is (C) 5 pm on the next day.
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is(C) 5 pm on the next day.
pred_before : (C) 5 pm on the next day.
