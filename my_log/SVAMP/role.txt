1st data
Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She already put in 10 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we first need to determine how many cups of sugar she has left to add.

The recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar, and she has already put in 10 cups. Therefore, she still needs to add 12 - 10 = 2 cups of sugar.

Now, let's calculate how many more cups of flour she needs to add. The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour, and since she hasn't added any yet, she needs to add the full amount.

To find the difference between the cups of flour and sugar, we subtract the cups of sugar from the cups of flour: 14 - 2 = 12.

Therefore, Mary needs to add 12 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is12.

Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 15 bottle caps and 18 wrappers at the park. Now he has 67 wrappers and 35 bottle caps in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps does danny have now?
To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers.

Initially, Danny had 15 bottle caps and 18 wrappers, so the difference was 18 - 15 = 3 more wrappers than bottle caps.

Now, Danny has 67 wrappers and 35 bottle caps. To find the difference, we subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers: 67 - 35 = 32 more wrappers than bottle caps.

Therefore, Danny currently has 32 more wrappers than bottle caps in his collection.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is32.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of flour 14 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of salt does she need to add now?
To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of salt Mary needs to add, we first need to determine the amount of flour and salt she has left to add.

Given:
Flour already added = 2 cups
Flour required = 12 cups
Salt required = 7 cups

To find the remaining flour needed, we subtract the flour already added from the total flour required:
Remaining flour needed = Flour required - Flour already added
Remaining flour needed = 12 cups - 2 cups
Remaining flour needed = 10 cups

Now, to find the remaining salt needed, we subtract the salt already added from the total salt required:
Remaining salt needed = Salt required - Salt already added
Remaining salt needed = 7 cups - 0 cups (since no salt has been added yet)
Remaining salt needed = 7 cups

Finally, to determine the difference between the remaining flour needed and the remaining salt needed, we subtract the remaining salt needed from the remaining flour needed:
Difference = Remaining flour needed - Remaining salt needed
Difference = 10 cups - 7 cups
Difference = 3 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of salt.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

To find out how much deeper the water is than Dean's height, we need to calculate the depth of the water and then subtract Dean's height from it.

Given that the depth of the water is 10 times Dean's height, and Dean stands at 9 feet, we can calculate the depth as follows:

Depth of water = 10 * Dean's height
              = 10 * 9 feet
              = 90 feet

To find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we need to subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold.

Total number of t-shirts sold = 186
Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game = 172

To find the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game, we can subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold:

Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = Total number of t-shirts sold - Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game
Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = 186 - 172
Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = 14

Now, to calculate the money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the profit per t-shirt:

Money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game = Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game * Profit per t-shirt
Money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game = 14 * $78
Money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game = $1092

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $1092 from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

The ring toss game at the carnival made the same amount of money each day. In total in 30 days they earned 420 dollars. Together with game they earned 22 dollars. How much did ring toss game make per day?
Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Let's assume the amount of money the ring toss game made per day is 'x' dollars.

We know that the ring toss game made the same amount of money each day, so the total amount of money made by the ring toss game in 30 days would be 30 times 'x', which is 30x dollars.

We also know that together with the game, they earned 22 dollars. So, the total earnings from the ring toss game and other games combined is 420 + 22 = 442 dollars.

Since the total earnings from the ring toss game in 30 days is 30x dollars, we can set up the equation:

30x = 442

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 30:

x = 442/30

Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us:

x = 14.73

Therefore, the ring toss game made approximately $14.73 per day.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isThe ring toss game made approximately $14.73 per day.

There were some birds sitting on the fence. 4 more birds came to join them. If there are a total of 5 birds on the fence now How many birds had been sitting on the fence at the start?
Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Let's assume the number of birds sitting on the fence at the start is "x". 

According to the problem, 4 more birds came to join them, so the total number of birds on the fence now is "x + 4". 

We are given that the total number of birds on the fence now is 5. So we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = 5

To find the value of "x", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 5 - 4

x = 1

Therefore, there had been 1 bird sitting on the fence at the start.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1.

Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon How many students suggested bacon?
Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding bacon to the menu as 'x'.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, which is 63 more than those who suggested bacon. So, the number of students who suggested bacon can be represented as 'x', and the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes can be represented as 'x + 63'.

Therefore, the total number of students who suggested either mashed potatoes or bacon is given by the sum of these two groups:

x + (x + 63) = 457

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 63 = 457

Subtracting 63 from both sides:

2x = 457 - 63

2x = 394

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 394 / 2

x = 197

So, 197 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.

Therefore, the answer is 197 students.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is197 students.

To find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has, we first need to determine the number of peaches and apples Jake has.

Given that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, we subtract 3 from Steven's 12 peaches:
12 - 3 = 9 peaches for Jake.

Similarly, Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, so we add 10 to Steven's 15 apples:
15 + 10 = 25 apples for Jake.

Now, let's compare the number of apples and peaches Steven has:
Steven has 12 peaches and 15 apples.

To find the difference between the number of apples and peaches, we subtract the number of peaches from the number of apples:

Initially, there were 23 children on the bus. Then, 24 children got on the bus at the bus stop. So, the total number of children on the bus after the new children boarded is 23 + 24 = 47.

Now, we know that after some children got off the bus, there were only 8 children left. To find out how many children got off, we subtract the final count from the count after the new children boarded: 47 - 8 = 39.

Therefore, 39 children got off the bus, which is 31 more children than those who got on (39 - 8 = 31).
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is31.

Let's solve the problem step by step. 

We know that Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, and Ed had 45 marbles. So, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 10

Since Ed had 45 marbles, we can substitute this value into the equation:

45 = Doug's marbles + 10

To find Doug's marbles, we need to isolate the variable. Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get:

45 - 10 = Doug's marbles
35 = Doug's marbles

So, Doug had 35 marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug. We can subtract Doug's marbles from Ed's marbles:

Ed's marbles - Doug's marbles = 45 - 35
Ed's marbles - Doug's marbles = 10

Therefore, Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug.

He then added 89 new apps, so the total number of apps became 21 + 89 = 110.

Afterward, Dave deleted some apps and was left with 24 apps.
To find out how many apps he deleted, we subtract the remaining apps from the total number of apps: 110 - 24 = 86.

Therefore, Dave added 89 apps and deleted 86 apps.
To determine how many more apps he added than he deleted, we subtract the number of deleted apps from the number of added apps: 89 - 86 = 3.

So, Dave added 3 more apps than he deleted.

In this case, we know that the book has 2 chapters across 23 pages. Let's denote the number of pages in the first chapter as "x". 

We are given that the first chapter is 10 pages long. So, we can set up an equation:

x + (23 - x) = 10

Here, (23 - x) represents the number of pages in the second chapter, as it is the remaining pages after the first chapter.

Simplifying the equation, we have:

23 - x = 10

To isolate "x", we can subtract 23 from both sides:

- x = 10 - 23

This gives us:

- x = -13

To solve for "x", we multiply both sides by -1 to change the sign:

x = 13

To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days, we need to add up the number of visitors for each day.

Given:
Day 1: 512 visitors
Day 2: 471 visitors
Day 3: 808 visitors

To find the total number of visitors in the past 89 days, we can assume that the pattern of visitors repeats every 3 days. So, we need to find how many sets of 3 days are there in 89 days.

89 divided by 3 equals 29 with a remainder of 2. This means there are 29 sets of 3 days and an additional 2 days.

Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors for the 29 sets of 3 days:
29 sets * (512 + 471 + 808) visitors = 29 sets * 1791 visitors = 51,939 visitors

Finally, let's add the visitors for the remaining 2 days:
Day 1: 512 visitors
Day 2: 471 visitors

Total visitors for the remaining 2 days: 512 + 471 = 983 visitors

46 campers went rowing on a day. 43 campers went rowing in the morning and some more campers went rowing in the afternoon. How many campers went rowing in the afternoon?
To find out how many campers went rowing in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the total number of campers who went rowing on that day.

Total campers who went rowing = 46
Campers who went rowing in the morning = 43

To find the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon, we can subtract the morning count from the total count:

Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon = Total campers who went rowing - Campers who went rowing in the morning
Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon = 46 - 43
Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon = 3

Therefore, 3 campers went rowing in the afternoon.

2 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop some more children got on the bus. Then there were 10 children altogether on the bus. How many more children are on the bus now than there were before the bus stop?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, there were 2 children on the bus. After some more children got on at the bus stop, the total number of children on the bus became 10. 

To find out how many more children got on the bus, we need to subtract the initial number of children from the final number. 

Final number of children on the bus - Initial number of children on the bus = Number of additional children

So, in this case, the calculation would be:

10 children - 2 children = 8 additional children

Therefore, there are 8 more children on the bus now than there were before the bus stop.

Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework How many pages of reading homework did she have to complete?
Let's solve this problem step by step. 

We know that Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework. Let's assume she had to complete x pages of reading homework.

According to the problem, Rachel had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework. So, we can set up the equation:

7 = x + 4

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's subtract 4 from both sides:

7 - 4 = x + 4 - 4

3 = x

Therefore, Rachel had to complete 3 pages of reading homework.

Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes How many students suggested bacon?
Let's solve the problem step by step. 

Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is x. 

According to the problem, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is 166 more than those who suggested mashed potatoes. So, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166.

We also know that a total of 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 166) = 182

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 166 = 182

Subtracting 166 from both sides:

2x = 16

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 8

So, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is 8.

To find the number of students who suggested adding bacon:

x + 166 = 8 + 166 = 174

Therefore, 174 students suggested adding bacon.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is174.

To find out how many white t-shirts your mom will have, we need to multiply the number of packages by the number of t-shirts in each package. 

Since each package contains 53 white t-shirts, we can calculate the total number of white t-shirts by multiplying 57 (the number of packages) by 53 (the number of t-shirts in each package):

57 packages * 53 t-shirts/package = 3,021 white t-shirts

Therefore, your mom will have a total of 3,021 white t-shirts.

Nell collects baseball cards. She had 573 cards. She gave 195 cards to John and yet some more to Jeff. Now she has 210 cards left. How many cards did Nell give to Jeff?
To find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff, we need to subtract the number of cards she gave to John from the total number of cards she had initially, and then subtract the remaining cards she has left.

Total number of cards Nell had = 573
Number of cards Nell gave to John = 195
Remaining cards after giving some to John = 573 - 195 = 378
Remaining cards after giving some to Jeff = 210

To find the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff, we subtract the remaining cards after giving some to Jeff from the remaining cards after giving some to John:

Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = Remaining cards after giving some to John - Remaining cards after giving some to Jeff
Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = 378 - 210 = 168

We know that Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 17 - 6 = 11 peaches. 

Similarly, Jake has 8 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 16 + 8 = 24 apples. 

Now, let's compare the number of peaches and apples Steven has. 

Steven has 17 peaches and 16 apples. 

To find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has, we subtract the number of apples from the number of peaches:

Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?
Let's solve this problem step by step. 

We know that Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After the first week of jogging, she lost 62 kilograms, so her weight decreased to 9 - 62 = -53 kilograms. 

However, it's not possible for someone's weight to be negative, so we need to consider this as an error or an incorrect value. 

Let's assume that the weight loss in the first week was a typo, and instead of 62 kilograms, it was meant to be 6.2 kilograms. 

So, after the first week, Jessie's weight would be 9 - 6.2 = 2.8 kilograms. 

In the second week, she lost 140 kilograms, so her weight decreased to 2.8 - 140 = -137.2 kilograms. 

Again, this negative weight is not possible, so we need to assume another error. 

Let's assume that the weight loss in the second week was also a typo, and instead of 140 kilograms, it was meant to be 14 kilograms. 

So, after the second week, Jessie's weight would be 2.8 - 14 = -11.2 kilograms. 

Once again, this negative weight is not possible, so we need to assume that there was an error in the given information. 

Without any further information or corrections, we cannot determine Jessie's weight before starting to jog.

Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds, and together their strawberries weighed 47 pounds. So, we can set up the equation:

30 pounds (Marco's strawberries) - x pounds (his dad's strawberries) = 47 pounds (total weight)

To solve for x (his dad's strawberry weight), we can rearrange the equation:

x pounds = 30 pounds - 47 pounds

x pounds = -17 pounds

Since we can't have a negative weight, it means that Marco's strawberries weighed 17 pounds more than his dad's strawberries.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is17 pounds.

According to the information given, Mary has already put in 4 cups of flour. Since the recipe calls for 9 cups of flour, she still needs to add 9 - 4 = 5 more cups of flour.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the cups of sugar and flour. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar, and Mary still needs to add 5 cups of flour. Therefore, she needs to add 11 - 5 = 6 more cups of sugar than cups of flour.

So, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of sugar than cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar 6 cups of flour and 9 cups of salt. She already put in 12 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?
To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt Mary needs to add now, we first need to determine the current amounts of sugar and salt in the cake.

According to the recipe:
- Sugar: 11 cups
- Flour: 6 cups
- Salt: 9 cups

However, Mary has already added 12 cups of flour. So, the current amounts are:
- Sugar: 11 cups
- Flour: 12 cups
- Salt: 9 cups

To find the difference between the cups of sugar and salt, we subtract the amount of salt from the amount of sugar:
11 cups of sugar - 9 cups of salt = 2 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar than cups of salt to the cake.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

Debby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day How many days would the soda bottles last?
To find out how many days the soda bottles would last, we need to determine the total number of soda bottles remaining after Debby drinks 9 bottles per day.

Debby bought 360 soda bottles and has not consumed any yet, so initially, she has 360 soda bottles.

If she drinks 9 soda bottles per day, we can calculate the number of days the soda bottles would last by dividing the total number of soda bottles by the number of bottles she drinks per day:

Number of days = Total number of soda bottles / Number of soda bottles consumed per day

Number of days = 360 soda bottles / 9 soda bottles per day

Number of days = 40 days

Therefore, the soda bottles would last for 40 days.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is40.

Rachel has 3 apple trees. She picked 8 apples from each of her trees. Now the trees have a total 9 apples still on them. How many apples were there on all trees initially?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Rachel has 3 apple trees, and she picked 8 apples from each tree. So, the total number of apples she picked is 3 * 8 = 24 apples.

Now, we know that after picking the apples, there are still 9 apples left on the trees. 

To find the initial number of apples on all the trees, we need to add the apples Rachel picked to the apples still on the trees. 

So, the initial number of apples on all the trees is 24 + 9 = 33 apples.

Therefore, there were initially 33 apples on all the trees.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is33.

The school is planning a field trip. The school has 67 classrooms. There are 66 students in each classroom in the school. If there are 6 seats on each school bus How many buses are needed to take the trip?
To determine the number of buses needed for the field trip, we need to calculate the total number of students and divide it by the number of seats on each bus.

The total number of students in the school can be found by multiplying the number of classrooms (67) by the number of students in each classroom (66):

Total number of students = 67 classrooms * 66 students/classroom = 4422 students

Now, we divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus (6) to find the number of buses needed:

Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of seats on each bus
Number of buses = 4422 students / 6 seats = 737 buses

Therefore, 737 buses are needed to accommodate all the students on the field trip.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is737 buses.

The Razorback shop makes $ 5 dollars off each jersey and $ 215 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 20 t-shirts and 64 jerseys. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?
To find out how much money the Razorback shop made from selling t-shirts, we need to multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the profit made from each t-shirt.

Given:
Profit per t-shirt = $215
Number of t-shirts sold = 20

To calculate the total profit from selling t-shirts, we multiply the profit per t-shirt by the number of t-shirts sold:

Total profit from t-shirts = Profit per t-shirt × Number of t-shirts sold
                           = $215 × 20
                           = $4300

Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds. If together their strawberries weighed 26 pounds. How much more did his dad's strawberries weigh than his?
To find out how much more his dad's strawberries weighed than Marco's, we need to subtract Marco's strawberry weight from the total weight of their strawberries.

Let's denote the weight of Marco's strawberries as M and the weight of his dad's strawberries as D.

According to the problem, Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds, so M = 10.

The total weight of their strawberries is given as 26 pounds, so M + D = 26.

To find D, we can subtract M from both sides of the equation:

D = 26 - M
D = 26 - 10
D = 16

Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 16 pounds, which is 6 pounds more than Marco's strawberries.

Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Let's assume that Mary put x cups of flour into the cake. 

According to the problem, she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. So, the amount of sugar she needs is 3 cups, and the amount of flour she needs is 3 + 5 = 8 cups. 

Since she already put x cups of flour, the total amount of flour she needs is 8 cups. 

Therefore, the equation becomes: 

x + 3 = 8 

To find the value of x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 

x = 8 - 3 

x = 5 

So, Mary put 5 cups of flour into the cake.

Let's assume the cost of each candy bar is "x" dollars. Since Dan bought 2 candy bars, the total cost would be 2 times the cost of each candy bar, which is 2x.

According to the problem, the total cost of the candy bars is $4. So we can write the equation:

2x = $4

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

2x/2 = $4/2
x = $2

Therefore, each candy bar costs $2.

In Haley's class 4 are boys who love to play marbles. If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 marbles for herself How many will each of the boys receive?
To find out how many marbles each of the boys will receive, we need to subtract the number of marbles Haley wants to keep from the total number of marbles she has.

Total marbles - Marbles Haley wants to keep = Marbles for the boys

23 - 15 = 8

So, there are 8 marbles available for the boys who love to play marbles. Since there are 4 boys, we can divide the marbles equally among them.

Marbles for the boys ÷ Number of boys = Marbles each boy will receive

8 ÷ 4 = 2

Therefore, each of the boys will receive 2 marbles.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2 marbles.

If they are already at 659 feet and the cave is 762 feet deep How much farther until they reach the end of the cave?
To determine how much farther they need to go until they reach the end of the cave, we can subtract the current depth from the total depth of the cave.

Total depth of the cave = 762 feet
Current depth = 659 feet

To find the remaining distance, we subtract the current depth from the total depth:

Remaining distance = Total depth - Current depth
Remaining distance = 762 feet - 659 feet
Remaining distance = 103 feet

Therefore, they need to go 103 feet farther until they reach the end of the cave.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is103 feet.

To find out how many more books you still have to read, we need to subtract the number of books you have already read from the total number of books in the series. 

Total number of books in the 'crazy silly school' series = 19 books
Number of books you have already read = 4 books

Books remaining to be read = Total number of books - Number of books already read
Books remaining to be read = 19 books - 4 books
Books remaining to be read = 15 books

Nell collects cards. She had 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?
To solve this problem, let's first find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff.

Nell initially had 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards, which gives a total of 438 + 18 = 456 cards.

After giving some cards to Jeff, Nell now has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left, which gives a total of 55 + 178 = 233 cards.

Therefore, Nell gave 456 - 233 = 223 cards to Jeff.

Now, let's calculate how many more baseball cards Nell has compared to Ace cards.

Nell initially had 438 baseball cards and now has 178 left, so she has 438 - 178 = 260 baseball cards.

Nell initially had 18 Ace cards and now has 55 left, so she has 55 - 18 = 37 Ace cards.

Therefore, Nell has 260 - 37 = 223 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

So, Nell has 223 more baseball cards than Ace cards.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is223.

Given that they harvest 38 sacks per day, we can calculate the total number of sacks harvested in 49 days as follows:

Total sacks harvested = sacks per day * number of days
Total sacks harvested = 38 sacks/day * 49 days
Total sacks harvested = 1862 sacks

Therefore, after 49 days of harvest, they will have 1862 sacks of oranges.

28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 28 children on the bus.
At the bus stop, 82 children got on the bus, so the total number of children on the bus became 28 + 82 = 110.

Now, let's assume that x children got off the bus.
After some children got off, the total number of children on the bus became 30.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
110 - x = 30

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's solve for x:

110 - x = 30
Subtract 110 from both sides:
110 - 110 - x = 30 - 110
-x = -80
Multiply both sides by -1 to isolate x:
(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-80)
x = 80

So, 80 children got off the bus.

To find the difference between the number of children who got on and off the bus, we subtract the number of children who got off from the number who got on:
82 - 80 = 2

Therefore, 2 more children got on the bus than those who got off.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

Initially, there were 21 roses in the vase.
Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase.
After that, she cut some more roses from her garden and put them in the vase, resulting in a total of 15 roses.

To find out how many more roses Jessica threw away than those she cut from her garden, we need to determine the difference between the number of roses she threw away and the number of roses she cut.

Number of roses Jessica threw away = 34
Number of roses she cut from her garden = ?
Number of roses in the vase after adding the new ones = 15

To find the number of roses she cut from her garden, we can subtract the number of roses she threw away from the total number of roses in the vase after adding the new ones:

Number of roses she cut from her garden = Total roses in the vase after adding new ones - Number of roses she threw away
Number of roses she cut from her garden = 15 - 34
Number of roses she cut from her garden = -19

Since the result is negative (-19), it means that Jessica did not cut any roses from her garden. Instead, she threw away more roses (19) than she cut.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isJessica threw away 19 more roses than she cut from her garden.

Every day Ryan spends 7 hours on learning english and some more hours on learning chinese. If he spends 2 hours more on learning english than on learning chinese How many hours does he spend on learning chinese?
Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Let's assume that Ryan spends x hours on learning Chinese. 

According to the problem, Ryan spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese. So, the time he spends on learning English would be x + 2 hours. 

Now, we know that Ryan spends a total of 7 hours on learning English and Chinese combined. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 

x + (x + 2) = 7

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

2x + 2 = 7

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we have: 

2x = 5

Dividing both sides by 2, we find: 

x = 2.5

So, Ryan spends 2.5 hours on learning Chinese.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.5 hours.

Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 49 bird families living near the mountain. 59 bird families flew away for winter and 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. How many bird families were left near the mountain?
To find out how many bird families were left near the mountain, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away for winter and add the number of new bird families that arrived. 

Given:
Number of bird families near the mountain = 49
Number of bird families that flew away for winter = 59
Number of new bird families that arrived = 24

To calculate the number of bird families left near the mountain, we can use the following equation:

Number of bird families left = Number of bird families near the mountain - Number of bird families that flew away + Number of new bird families

Substituting the given values into the equation:

Number of bird families left = 49 - 59 + 24

Now, let's solve the equation:

Number of bird families left = -10 + 24
Number of bird families left = 14

Therefore, there were 14 bird families left near the mountain after 59 bird families flew away for winter and 24 new bird families arrived.

Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we subtract 6 from Steven's number of peaches: 14 - 6 = 8 peaches.

Jake also has 3 more peaches than Jill. Let's assume Jill has x peaches. Therefore, Jake has x + 3 peaches.

Since we know that Jake has 8 peaches, we can set up an equation: x + 3 = 8.

To find the value of x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: x = 8 - 3.

Simplifying, we find that Jill has x = 5 peaches.

There are 6 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 16 red peaches and 18 green peaches. How many red peaches are in the baskets altogether?
To find the total number of red peaches in all the baskets, we need to multiply the number of red peaches in each basket by the total number of baskets.

In this case, each basket has 16 red peaches, and there are 6 baskets in total. So, we can calculate the total number of red peaches by multiplying 16 by 6:

16 red peaches/basket * 6 baskets = 96 red peaches

Therefore, there are 96 red peaches in the baskets altogether.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is96.

Nell collects cards. She had 239 baseball cards and 38 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards left. How many more Ace cards than baseball cards does Nell have?
To solve this problem, let's first find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff.

Nell initially had 239 baseball cards and 38 Ace cards, which gives a total of 239 + 38 = 277 cards.

After giving some cards to Jeff, Nell now has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards left, which gives a total of 376 + 111 = 487 cards.

Therefore, Nell gave 487 - 277 = 210 cards to Jeff.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of Ace cards and baseball cards Nell has:

Nell has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards, so the difference is 376 - 111 = 265.

Therefore, Nell has 265 more Ace cards than baseball cards.

So, Nell has 265 more Ace cards than baseball cards.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is265.

For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?
To calculate the total number of nails John needs for the house wall, we need to consider the number of nails required for the large planks and the additional nails needed for the smaller planks.

Number of nails needed for large planks:
Each large plank requires 17 nails.
Since John has 13 large planks, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is 13 * 17 = 221 nails.

Number of nails needed for smaller planks:
For some smaller planks, John needs an additional 8 nails.

Total number of nails needed:
To find the total number of nails needed, we add the nails required for the large planks and the additional nails for the smaller planks:
221 + 8 = 229 nails.

Therefore, John needs 229 nails for the house wall.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is229.

Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?
To find out how much carpet Jesse needs to cover the floors of all her rooms, we first need to calculate the area of one room and then multiply it by the total number of rooms.

The area of a rectangular room can be found by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, the length is 19 feet and the width is 18 feet. So, the area of one room is:

Area of one room = Length × Width = 19 feet × 18 feet = 342 square feet

Now, since Jesse has 20 rooms in total, we can find the total area of all the rooms by multiplying the area of one room by the number of rooms:

Total area of all rooms = Area of one room × Number of rooms = 342 square feet × 20 rooms = 6840 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs 6840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all her rooms.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6840.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. She already put in 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we first need to determine how many cups of sugar she has left to add.

The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar, and she has already added 4 cups. Therefore, she still needs to add 6 - 4 = 2 cups of sugar.

Now, let's calculate how many more cups of flour she needs to add. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour, and she hasn't added any yet. Thus, she needs to add 9 - 0 = 9 cups of flour.

To find the difference between the number of cups of flour and sugar she needs to add, we subtract the number of cups of sugar from the number of cups of flour: 9 - 2 = 7.

Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.

Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven and 8 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 17 peaches. How many peaches does Jill have?
To solve this problem, let's start by finding out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 17 peaches. So, Jake has 17 - 7 = 10 peaches.

Now, we also know that Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill. Let's denote the number of peaches Jill has as J. Therefore, we can set up the equation: Jake's peaches = Jill's peaches + 8.

Substituting the values we know, we have 10 = J + 8.

To isolate J, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 10 - 8 = J + 8 - 8.

Simplifying, we get 2 = J.

Therefore, Jill has 2 peaches.

To find out how many people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, we need to calculate the total number of working seats. 

Given that the Ferris wheel has 18 seats and 10 seats are broken, we subtract the number of broken seats from the total number of seats to find the number of working seats:

Total number of working seats = Total number of seats - Number of broken seats
Total number of working seats = 18 - 10
Total number of working seats = 8

Since each working seat can hold 15 people, we multiply the number of working seats by the capacity of each seat:

Total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel = Total number of working seats * Capacity of each seat
Total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel = 8 * 15
Total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel = 120

Therefore, 120 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, considering the broken seats.

Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are some bird families living near the mountain. 20 bird families flew away for winter while 14 bird families stayed behind. How many bird families were living near the mountain at the start?
To find the total number of bird families living near the mountain at the start, we can add the number of families that flew away for winter and the number of families that stayed behind.

Number of bird families that flew away for winter = 20
Number of bird families that stayed behind = 14

Total number of bird families at the start = Number of families that flew away + Number of families that stayed behind
Total number of bird families at the start = 20 + 14
Total number of bird families at the start = 34

Therefore, there were 34 bird families living near the mountain at the start.

Jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 2 more action figures to the shelf and removed 7 of the old ones. If there are 10 action figures on his shelf now How many action figures did he have initially on the shelf?
To solve this problem, let's use algebra. Let's assume that Jerry initially had "x" action figures on the shelf.

According to the problem, Jerry added 2 more action figures, so the total number of action figures became "x + 2".

Then, Jerry removed 7 of the old action figures, which means we subtract 7 from the total: "x + 2 - 7".

We know that the final number of action figures on the shelf is 10, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 - 7 = 10

Now, let's solve for x:

x - 5 = 10

Adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

x - 5 + 5 = 10 + 5

x = 15

Therefore, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is15.

2. He bought a candy bar for $8, so we need to subtract $8 from his initial amount: $4 - $8 = -$4.
   Since Dan had only $4 and the candy bar cost $8, he now has a negative balance of -$4.

3. After that, his friend gave him $5. To find the new balance, we add $5 to the current amount: -$4 + $5 = $1.
   So, after receiving $5 from his friend, Dan now has $1.

Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and they put 10 seeds in each flower bed. If they planted 60 seeds altogther How many flower beds did they have?
To find the number of flower beds, we can divide the total number of seeds planted by the number of seeds in each flower bed. 

Let's denote the number of flower beds as 'x'. We know that 10 seeds were planted in each flower bed, and a total of 60 seeds were planted altogether. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

10 * x = 60

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 60 / 10

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = 6

Therefore, Paige and her mom had 6 flower beds in total.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

To solve this problem, let's work backwards. We know that Edward currently has $7 after receiving $10 from his friend. So, before receiving that $10, he must have had $7 - $10 = -$3.

Now, we know that Edward initially had -$3 before receiving the $10. To find out how much he had before spending his money, we need to add the $17 he spent to the -$3 he had initially.

Therefore, Edward had -$3 + $17 = $14 before he spent his money.

Julia played tag with 5 kids on monday. She played tag with some more kids on tuesday. If she played with a total of 15 kids How many kids did she play with on tuesday?
Let's solve the problem step by step. 

We know that Julia played tag with 5 kids on Monday. Let's represent this number as "x."

On Tuesday, she played with some more kids, and the total number of kids she played with was 15. We can represent this as the sum of the kids she played with on Monday (5) and the kids she played with on Tuesday (y): 

5 + y = 15

To find the value of "y," we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

y = 15 - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

y = 10

Therefore, Julia played with 10 kids on Tuesday.

Let's solve this problem step by step. 

We know that Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed a total of 24 pounds. However, Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries on the way back, so we need to subtract that from the total weight.

Total weight of strawberries collected - Weight lost by Marco = Weight of Marco's strawberries

24 pounds - 9 pounds = 15 pounds

So, Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed. We can do this by subtracting Marco's strawberries' weight from the total weight.

Total weight of strawberries collected - Weight of Marco's strawberries = Weight of dad's strawberries

24 pounds - 15 pounds = 9 pounds

Therefore, his dad's strawberries weighed 9 pounds.

So, Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds, and his dad's strawberries weighed 9 pounds.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isMarco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds, and his dad's strawberries weighed 9 pounds.

Currently, Kelly has 22 games, and after buying x games, she will have 140 games left. So, we can write the equation:

22 + x = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 22 from both sides:

x = 140 - 22
x = 118

Given:
Number of campers who went rowing in the morning = 41
Number of campers who went hiking in the morning = 4

So, the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the morning is 41 + 4 = 45.

Since we want to find the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all, we need to add the number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the morning to the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon.

Total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all = Number of campers who went rowing and hiking in the morning + Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon
Total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all = 45 + 26 = 71

Matthew had 23 crackers. He has 11 crackers left after he gave equal numbers of crackers to his 2 friends. How many crackers did each friend eat?
To solve this problem, we can use basic subtraction. Matthew started with 23 crackers and gave an equal number to each of his two friends. We need to find out how many crackers each friend ate.

Let's assume that each friend ate x number of crackers.

So, Matthew gave x crackers to the first friend and x crackers to the second friend. Therefore, the total number of crackers given to the friends is 2x.

We know that Matthew has 11 crackers left after giving the crackers to his friends. So, we can set up the equation:

23 - 2x = 11

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's solve the equation step by step:

23 - 2x = 11
Subtract 23 from both sides:
-2x = 11 - 23
Simplify:
-2x = -12
Divide both sides by -2 to solve for x:
x = -12 / -2
x = 6

Therefore, each friend ate 6 crackers.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isEach friend ate 6 crackers.

Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Initially, Jerry had 7 action figures on the shelf. Later, he added some more action figures and removed 10 of the old ones. 

So, we can represent the situation as follows:

Initial number of action figures = 7
Number of action figures added = x (unknown)
Number of action figures removed = 10

After these changes, the total number of action figures on the shelf is 8.

We can set up an equation to solve for x:

7 + x - 10 = 8

Simplifying the equation, we have:

x - 3 = 8

Adding 3 to both sides of the equation:

x = 11

Therefore, Jerry added 11 action figures to the shelf.

Jesse's room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide. If each tile is of size 4 square feet How many tiles does she need to cover the whole floor?
To find out how many tiles Jesse needs to cover the entire floor, we first need to calculate the total area of the floor.

The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, the length of Jesse's room is 2 feet, and the width is 12 feet.

Area = Length × Width
Area = 2 feet × 12 feet
Area = 24 square feet

Since each tile is 4 square feet, we can divide the total area of the floor by the area of each tile to determine the number of tiles needed.

Number of tiles = Total area ÷ Area of each tile
Number of tiles = 24 square feet ÷ 4 square feet
Number of tiles = 6 tiles

Therefore, Jesse needs 6 tiles to cover the entire floor of her room.

Let's solve the problem step by step. 

Let's assume that Doug initially had x marbles. According to the problem, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had (x + 2) marbles.

After Doug lost some marbles at the playground, let's say he lost y marbles. Therefore, Doug now has (x - y) marbles.

According to the problem, Ed now has 19 more marbles than Doug. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - y) + 19 = (x + 2)

Now, let's solve the equation:

x - y + 19 = x + 2

Subtracting x from both sides:

-x - y + 19 = 2

Subtracting 19 from both sides:

-x - y = -17

Rearranging the equation:

y = x + 17

To find out how many pencils Faye has, we need to calculate the total number of pencils in each pack and then multiply it by the number of packs she has.

In each pack, Faye has 14 pencils. Since she has 6 packs, we can multiply 14 by 6 to find the total number of pencils in all the packs:

14 pencils/pack * 6 packs = 84 pencils

Now, we know that Faye has a total of 84 pencils in the packs.

Next, we need to determine how many pencils she can place in rows with 22 pencils each. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row:

84 pencils ÷ 22 pencils/row = 3 rows (with some pencils left over)

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

Olivia initially had 3 dollars in her wallet.
She collected 49 more dollars from an ATM.
After visiting the supermarket, she had 49 dollars left.

To find out how much more money Olivia collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she collected and the amount she had left.

Amount collected at the ATM = Initial amount + Amount collected = 3 + 49 = 52 dollars
Amount spent at the supermarket = Amount collected - Amount left = 52 - 49 = 3 dollars

Therefore, Olivia collected 52 dollars at the ATM and spent 3 dollars at the supermarket. The difference between the two amounts is 52 - 3 = 49 dollars. So, Olivia collected 49 dollars more at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket.

Danny collects bottle caps. He found 63 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 51 old ones. Now he has 33 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we can work backwards from the information given.

We know that Danny found 63 bottle caps at the park and threw away 51 old ones. So, the total number of bottle caps he had after finding them at the park would be 63 - 51 = 12.

Now, we are told that Danny currently has 33 bottle caps in his collection. This means that the initial number of bottle caps he had must have been 33 + 12 = 45.

Therefore, Danny had 45 bottle caps at first.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is45.

Every day Ryan spends 4 hours on learning english and 6 hours on learning chinese. If he learns for 86 days How many hours does he spend on learning english and chinese each day?
To find out how many hours Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese each day, we need to divide the total number of hours he spends on each subject by the number of days.

Ryan spends 4 hours on learning English and 6 hours on learning Chinese every day. 

So, the total number of hours he spends on learning English and Chinese each day is 4 + 6 = 10 hours.

Since Ryan learns for 86 days, we can divide the total number of hours (86 days * 10 hours/day) by the number of days to find the average number of hours he spends on each subject per day.

(86 * 10) / 86 = 10

Therefore, Ryan spends an average of 4 hours on learning English and 6 hours on learning Chinese each day.

To find out how many crayons Paul lost or gave away, we can add the number of crayons he gave to his friends and the number of crayons he lost. Let's denote the number of crayons lost or given away as "x".

Given:
Number of crayons given to friends = 52
Number of crayons lost = 535
Number of crayons left = 492

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to determine the number of boys first. 

Let's assume the number of boys is "x." According to the given information, there are 458 more girls than boys. So, the number of girls can be expressed as "x + 458."

We know that there are 692 girls in the school. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

To solve for x, we subtract 458 from both sides of the equation:

x = 692 - 458
x = 234

So, there are 234 boys in the school. 

To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of boys and girls:

Total number of pupils = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of pupils = 234 + 692
Total number of pupils = 926

Nell collects cards. She had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left. How many more Ace cards than baseball cards does Nell have?
To solve this problem, let's first find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff.

Nell initially had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards, which gives a total of 246 + 214 = 460 cards.

After giving some cards to Jeff, Nell now has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards, which gives a total of 404 + 495 = 899 cards.

Therefore, Nell gave 899 - 460 = 439 cards to Jeff.

Now, let's calculate how many more Ace cards than baseball cards Nell has.

Initially, Nell had 214 Ace cards and now has 495 Ace cards, which means she gained 495 - 214 = 281 Ace cards.

Similarly, Nell initially had 246 baseball cards and now has 404 baseball cards, which means she gained 404 - 246 = 158 baseball cards.

Therefore, Nell has 281 - 158 = 123 more Ace cards than baseball cards.

So, Nell has 123 more Ace cards than baseball cards.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is123.

To find the number of pots, we can divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each pot. 

Given that each pot has 40 flowers and there are 400 flowers in total, we can set up the following equation:

Total number of flowers = Number of flowers per pot × Number of pots

400 = 40 × Number of pots

To solve for the number of pots, we divide both sides of the equation by 40:

Number of pots = 400 ÷ 40

Number of pots = 10

Therefore, there are 10 pots in total.

Edward spent $ 16 to buy 92 books each book costing him the same amount of money. Now he has $ 6. How much did Edward have before he spent his money?
To solve this problem, let's assume that each book costs x dollars. 

Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books, so the total cost of the books is 16 dollars. Since each book costs the same amount, we can set up the equation:

92x = 16

To find the cost of each book, we divide both sides of the equation by 92:

x = 16/92

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

x = 4/23

So, each book costs 4/23 dollars.

Now, we know that Edward has $6 remaining. Let's subtract the cost of the books from the amount he has left:

6 - 16 = -10

This means that Edward had -$10 before he spent his money on the books.

Note: It's important to double-check the problem statement, as it seems there might be an error or missing information.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isEdward had -$10 before he spent his money.

To find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did, we need to calculate the difference between the number of crunches and push-ups he did.

Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches.
David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups.
David also did 62 fewer crunches than Zachary, so he did 58 - 62 = -4 crunches.

Since it doesn't make sense to have negative crunches, we can assume that David didn't do any crunches. Therefore, Zachary did 58 - 0 = 58 more crunches than push-ups.

So, Zachary did 58 more crunches than push-ups.

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the distances jumped by both the frog and the mouse.

Given:
Grasshopper's jump: 24 inches
Frog's jump: 33 inches more than the grasshopper's jump
Mouse's jump: 5 inches less than the frog's jump

Let's calculate the frog's jump:
Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 33 inches
Frog's jump = 24 inches + 33 inches
Frog's jump = 57 inches

Now, let's calculate the mouse's jump:
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 5 inches
Mouse's jump = 57 inches - 5 inches
Mouse's jump = 52 inches

Finally, to determine how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump:
Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump = 52 inches - 24 inches
Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump = 28 inches

Therefore, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 7 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 22 marbles How many marbles does Doug have now?
Let's solve the problem step by step. 

We know that Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug, and Ed had 22 marbles. So, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 6

Substituting the given value, we have:

22 = Doug's marbles + 6

To find Doug's marbles, we need to isolate the variable. Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get:

22 - 6 = Doug's marbles
16 = Doug's marbles

Therefore, Doug initially had 16 marbles.

Next, we are told that Doug lost 7 of his marbles at the playground. To find out how many marbles Doug has now, we subtract 7 from his initial amount:

Doug's marbles now = Doug's marbles - 7
Doug's marbles now = 16 - 7
Doug's marbles now = 9

So, Doug now has 9 marbles.

Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill. If Jill has 12 peaches How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jill has 12 peaches.
2. Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill, so Steven has 12 + 15 = 27 peaches.
3. Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 27 - 16 = 11 peaches.

Now, to find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we subtract Jake's number of peaches from Jill's:

Jill's peaches - Jake's peaches = 12 - 11 = 1.

Therefore, Jill has 1 more peach than Jake.

Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
Let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume that Adam has x apples and Jackie has y apples.

According to the problem, we know that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. So, we can write the equation: x = y + 8. 

We also know that together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. So, we can write another equation: x + y = 12.

Now, let's substitute the value of x from the first equation into the second equation:

(y + 8) + y = 12
2y + 8 = 12
2y = 12 - 8
2y = 4
y = 4/2
y = 2

Now that we know Jackie has 2 apples, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find Adam's number of apples:

x = 2 + 8
x = 10

So, Adam has 10 apples.

Finally, to find the number of apples He has, we add Adam and Jackie's apples together:

He = x + y
He = 10 + 2
He = 12

Therefore, He has 12 apples.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isHe has 12 apples.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there were 15 roses in the vase.
Jessica then threw away 33 roses from the vase.
So, the number of roses remaining in the vase after throwing away is 15 - 33 = -18.

However, the problem states that there are now 17 roses in the vase.
To go from -18 to 17, Jessica must have added 18 + 17 = 35 roses.

Therefore, Jessica cut 35 - 33 = 2 more roses than she threw away.

Matthew had 15 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends and still had 10 crackers left How many crackers did each friend eat?
To solve this problem, we can use basic division. 

Matthew started with 15 crackers and gave an equal number of crackers to each of his 5 friends. Let's assume each friend received x number of crackers.

So, the total number of crackers given to the friends is 5x. 

After giving away the crackers, Matthew still had 10 crackers left. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 

15 - 5x = 10

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 

5 - 5x = 0

Now, let's solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 5: 

-5x = -5

Dividing both sides by -5, we find: 

x = 1

He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 67 sacks per day and that each sack containes 12 oranges. How many oranges are harvested if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges?
To find out how many oranges are harvested when they harvest a total of 35 sacks, we need to multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges in each sack.

Given that each sack contains 12 oranges, we can calculate the total number of oranges harvested as follows:

Total number of oranges = Number of sacks * Number of oranges per sack

Total number of oranges = 35 sacks * 12 oranges per sack

Total number of oranges = 420 oranges

Therefore, if they harvest a total of 35 sacks of oranges, they will harvest 420 oranges in total.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is420.

Jesse's room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide. If she already has 16 square feet of carpet How much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?
To find out how much more carpet Jesse needs to cover the entire floor, we first need to calculate the total area of her room. The area of a rectangle can be found by multiplying its length by its width.

Given:
Length of the room = 11 feet
Width of the room = 15 feet

To find the area of the room:
Area = Length × Width

Area = 11 feet × 15 feet
Area = 165 square feet

Now, we can determine how much more carpet Jesse needs by subtracting the area she already has from the total area of the room.

More carpet needed = Total area of the room - Area already covered
More carpet needed = 165 square feet - 16 square feet
More carpet needed = 149 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 149 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor of her room.

To find out how many more girls than boys the school has, we need to calculate the difference between the number of girls and the number of boys.

Initially, the school has 362 boys and 257 girls. So, the difference is:

257 (girls) - 362 (boys) = -105

Since the result is negative, it means that there are 105 more boys than girls in the school.

However, 403 more girls joined the school. To account for this, we add 403 to the number of girls:

257 (initial girls) + 403 (new girls) = 660 (total girls)

Now, let's calculate the difference between the total number of girls and the number of boys:

660 (girls) - 362 (boys) = 298

Therefore, after the new girls joined, the school has 298 more girls than boys.

Danny collects bottle caps. He lost 66 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 25 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we can use a simple equation. Let's assume that the initial number of bottle caps Danny had is represented by "x".

According to the problem, Danny lost 66 bottle caps at the park, so we subtract that from the initial number of bottle caps:
x - 66

After losing those 66 bottle caps, Danny now has 25 bottle caps in his collection. So we set up the equation:
x - 66 = 25

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Adding 66 to both sides gives us:
x - 66 + 66 = 25 + 66
x = 91

Therefore, Danny had 91 bottle caps at first.

Let's solve the problem step by step. 

We know that there are 10 red peaches in the basket. Let's represent the number of green peaches as 'x'. 

The total number of peaches in the basket is given as 15. So, we can set up the equation:

10 (red peaches) + x (green peaches) = 15 (total peaches)

Now, let's solve for 'x':

10 + x = 15

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 15 - 10

x = 5

Therefore, there are 5 green peaches in the basket.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is5.

Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 82 wrappers and 29 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 42 bottle caps and 61 wrappers in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he currently has from the total number of bottle caps he found and add the number of bottle caps he had initially.

Total number of bottle caps Danny found: 29
Total number of bottle caps Danny currently has: 42

Let's calculate the number of bottle caps Danny had at first:

Number of bottle caps Danny had at first = Total number of bottle caps found - Number of bottle caps currently has + Number of bottle caps initially had
                                               = 29 - 42 + Number of bottle caps initially had

To solve for the number of bottle caps initially had, we rearrange the equation:

Number of bottle caps initially had = Number of bottle caps found - Number of bottle caps currently has + Number of bottle caps initially had
                                      = 29 - 42 + Number of bottle caps initially had

Now, let's substitute the given values into the equation:

Number of bottle caps initially had = 29 - 42 + Number of bottle caps initially had

To simplify the equation, we can combine like terms:

Number of bottle caps initially had - Number of bottle caps initially had = 29 - 42

The left side of the equation simplifies to zero:

0 = 29 - 42

Now, let's solve for the right side of the equation:

0 = -13

Paco had 39 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies. He ate 23 salty cookies and 32 sweet cookies. How many more sweet cookies than salty cookies did he eat?
To find out how many more sweet cookies Paco ate compared to salty cookies, we need to subtract the number of salty cookies he ate from the number of sweet cookies he ate.

Paco initially had 39 sweet cookies and ate 32 of them, leaving him with 39 - 32 = 7 sweet cookies remaining.

He initially had 6 salty cookies and ate 23 of them, leaving him with 6 - 23 = -17 salty cookies remaining.

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, we consider that Paco ate 0 salty cookies.

Therefore, Paco ate 32 - 0 = 32 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is32.

An industrial machine can make 3 shirts a minute. It made 4 shirts yesterday and 8 shirts today. How many minutes did the machine work in all?
To find out how many minutes the machine worked in total, we need to calculate the time it took to make the shirts on both days.

Yesterday, the machine made 4 shirts, so it took 4 shirts / 3 shirts per minute = 1.33... minutes to make those shirts.

Today, the machine made 8 shirts, so it took 8 shirts / 3 shirts per minute = 2.66... minutes to make those shirts.

To find the total time, we add the time from yesterday and today: 1.33... minutes + 2.66... minutes = 3.99... minutes.

Therefore, the machine worked for approximately 3.99... minutes in total.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isapproximately 3.99 minutes.

To find out how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on that day compared to the previous 245 days, we need to calculate the total number of visitors on those 245 days.

The number of visitors on the previous day was 191, and the day before that was 457. So, the total number of visitors on those two days is 191 + 457 = 648.

Now, to find the total number of visitors on the previous 245 days, we subtract 648 from the total number of visitors on that day, which is 705.

705 - 648 = 57

Therefore, there were 57 more visitors on that day compared to the previous 245 days.

4 birds and 3 storks were sitting on the fence. 6 more storks came to join them. How many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence?
To solve this problem, let's first determine the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence. We have 4 birds and 3 storks initially, so the total is 4 + 3 = 7.

Next, we need to find out how many more storks joined them. The problem states that 6 more storks came to join. Therefore, we add 6 to the initial number of storks: 3 + 6 = 9.

Now, let's compare the number of storks to the number of birds. We have 9 storks and 4 birds. To find out how many more storks there are than birds, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks: 9 - 4 = 5.

So, there are 5 more storks than birds sitting on the fence.

To solve this problem, let's work backwards. We know that currently, the tree has 6 apples. Before that, 2 new apples grew on the tree, so we can subtract those 2 apples to find the number of apples before they grew. 

6 apples + 2 new apples = 8 apples

Now, we know that the tree had 8 apples before the 2 new apples grew. 

Before that, Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree, so we subtract those 7 apples from the total. 

8 apples - 7 apples = 1 apple

Therefore, the tree originally had 1 apple on it.

The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?
To find out how far the frog jumped, let's start by determining the difference between the frog's jump and the grasshopper's jump. 

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 

The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we add 39 to the grasshopper's jump: 19 + 39 = 58 inches. 

Now, we need to find the difference between the frog's jump and the mouse's jump. 

The mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog, so we subtract 94 from the frog's jump: 58 - 94 = -36 inches. 

However, it doesn't make sense for the mouse to have a negative jump, so we need to correct this. 

Since the mouse's jump is lesser than the frog's, we can say that the mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog. 

To find the frog's jump, we add 94 inches to the grasshopper's jump: 58 + 94 = 152 inches. 

Therefore, the frog jumped 152 inches.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is152 inches.

The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 9 inches. The mouse jumped 3 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. How far did the mouse jump?
Let's break down the information given:

The grasshopper jumped 9 inches.
Let's call the distance the frog jumped "F" inches.
The mouse jumped 3 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped (F - 3) inches.
The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so F = 9 + 33.

To find the distance the mouse jumped, we need to substitute the value of F into the expression (F - 3).

F = 9 + 33
F = 42

Now, we can calculate the distance the mouse jumped:

Mouse's jump = (F - 3) = (42 - 3) = 39 inches.

Therefore, the mouse jumped 39 inches.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is39 inches.

Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Let's assume that Mary put x cups of flour into the cake. 

According to the problem, she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. So, the amount of sugar she needs is (x - 2) cups. 

The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar.

To find out how many crayons Paul received for his birthday, we can use a simple equation. Let's denote the number of crayons he received as "x".

According to the information given, Paul gave away 563 crayons to his friends and lost 558 crayons. Therefore, the total number of crayons he no longer has is 563 + 558 = 1121 crayons.

If he only has 332 crayons left, we can subtract this from the total number of crayons he initially received:

x - 1121 = 332

To solve for x, we can add 1121 to both sides of the equation:

x = 332 + 1121

To find out how many flowers they grew, we need to determine the total number of flower beds they planted and then multiply that by the number of flowers that grew in each bed.

Since they planted 15 seeds in each flower bed, the number of flower beds can be found by dividing the total number of seeds planted (55) by the number of seeds in each bed (15):

Number of flower beds = Total seeds planted / Seeds in each bed
Number of flower beds = 55 / 15
Number of flower beds = 3 remainder 10

So, they planted 3 flower beds with 15 seeds each, and there were 10 extra seeds remaining.

However, we know that only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. Since they planted 3 flower beds, we can multiply the number of flower beds by the number of flowers that grew in each bed:

Total number of flowers = Number of flower beds * Flowers in each bed
Total number of flowers = 3 * 60
Total number of flowers = 180

Therefore, Paige and her mom grew a total of 180 flowers.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is180.

Lewis earns $ 21 every week during the 216 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 702 tax How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?
To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to subtract the tax amount from his total earnings.

Lewis earns $21 every week for 216 weeks, so his total earnings would be:
Total earnings = $21/week * 216 weeks = $4536

Now, we subtract the tax amount from his total earnings:
Money at the end of the harvest season = Total earnings - Tax amount
Money at the end of the harvest season = $4536 - $702 = $3834

Therefore, Lewis will have $3834 at the end of the harvest season after paying the $702 tax.

Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet. If her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide How much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?
To find out how much more carpet Jesse needs to cover the entire floor, we first need to calculate the area of her room. The area of a rectangle can be found by multiplying its length by its width.

Given:
Length of the room = 4 feet
Width of the room = 20 feet

Area of the room = Length × Width
Area of the room = 4 feet × 20 feet
Area of the room = 80 square feet

Now, we can determine how much more carpet Jesse needs by subtracting the area of the room from the amount of carpet she already has.

Carpet needed = Area of the room - Amount of carpet Jesse has
Carpet needed = 80 square feet - 18 square feet
Carpet needed = 62 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 62 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor.

Olivia spent 38 dollars at a supermarket. If there were 128 dollars in her wallet initially How much money does she have left?
To find out how much money Olivia has left, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had in her wallet.

Initial amount in her wallet = $128
Amount spent at the supermarket = $38

To calculate the remaining amount, we subtract the amount spent from the initial amount:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Amount spent
Remaining amount = $128 - $38
Remaining amount = $90

Therefore, Olivia has $90 left in her wallet.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$90.

The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 14 inches. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the difference between their respective jumps.

Given:
Grasshopper's jump = 14 inches
Frog's jump = 37 inches + Grasshopper's jump
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 16 inches

First, let's find the frog's jump:
Frog's jump = 37 inches + 14 inches = 51 inches

Now, let's find the mouse's jump:
Mouse's jump = 51 inches - 16 inches = 35 inches

To determine how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we calculate the difference between their jumps:
Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump = 35 inches - 14 inches = 21 inches

Therefore, the mouse jumped 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is21 inches.

Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 551 of them and only had 177 left. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?
To find out how many crayons Paul received for his birthday, we can set up an equation. Let's assume the number of crayons he initially received is "x."

According to the problem, by the end of the school year, Paul had lost or given away 551 crayons, leaving him with only 177 crayons. This can be expressed as:

x - 551 = 177

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Adding 551 to both sides, we get:

x = 177 + 551
x = 728

Therefore, Paul received 728 crayons for his birthday.

After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 92 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace before that day?
To find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham Palace before the day mentioned, we need to add up the number of visitors from the previous days.

Given:
- 92 visitors came to the Buckingham Palace on the current day.
- 419 visitors came the day before.
- 103 visitors came two days before.

To find the total number of visitors before the mentioned day, we add the number of visitors from each day:

Total visitors = 419 + 103 + previous day's visitors

Since the previous day's visitors are unknown, we'll represent it as 'x'.

Total visitors = 419 + 103 + x

Now, we know that the total visitors on the current day were 92:

92 = 419 + 103 + x

To find 'x', we can simplify the equation:

92 = 522 + x

Subtracting 522 from both sides:

92 - 522 = x

-430 = x

Therefore, the number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace before the mentioned day was -430. However, since the number of visitors cannot be negative, it seems there might be an error in the given information or calculations. Please double-check the data provided, and let me know if you have any further information or questions.

Every day Ryan spends 3 hours on learning english and some more hours on learning chinese. If he spends a total of 4 hours on learning english and chinese everyday How many hours does he spend on learning chinese?
Let's solve this problem step by step. We know that Ryan spends 3 hours on learning English every day. Let's represent the number of hours he spends on learning Chinese as "x".

According to the problem, the total time Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese is 4 hours. So, we can write the equation:

3 (hours on English) + x (hours on Chinese) = 4 (total hours)

Now, let's solve for "x":

3 + x = 4

Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = 4 - 3

x = 1

Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour on learning Chinese every day.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?
To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt Mary needs to add, we first need to determine the amount of sugar and salt she has already added.

Given:
Flour already added = 5 cups
Flour required = 6 cups

To find the remaining flour needed, we subtract the flour already added from the required amount:
Remaining flour needed = Flour required - Flour already added
Remaining flour needed = 6 cups - 5 cups
Remaining flour needed = 1 cup

Now, let's calculate the difference between the cups of sugar and salt needed:

Sugar required = 8 cups
Salt required = 7 cups

Difference = Sugar required - Salt required
Difference = 8 cups - 7 cups
Difference = 1 cup

Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of sugar than cups of salt.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar How many more cups of flour does she need to add?
Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Let's assume that Mary has already put in "x" cups of flour. 

According to the problem, she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. So, the amount of sugar she has put in is "x - 8" cups. 

The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 

x = 6 (flour) 
x - 8 = 13 (sugar) 

To find the value of "x," we can solve the second equation for "x." 

x - 8 = 13 
x = 13 + 8 
x = 21 

So, Mary has already put in 21 cups of flour. 

To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we subtract the amount she has already put in from the total required amount. 

Total required amount of flour = 6 cups 
Amount already put in = 21 cups 

Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 - 21 = -15 cups of flour. 

However, a negative value doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be an error in the problem statement or calculations. Please double-check the information provided, and I'll be happy to assist you further.

To solve this problem, let's use algebra. Let's assume that the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is represented by the variable 'x'. 

Given that 15 campers went rowing in the morning, we can set up the equation:

15 + x = 32

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we have:

x = 32 - 15

Simplifying the right side, we get:

Then, 3 more birds came to join them. Adding these 3 birds to the initial count, we have 8 + 3 = 11 birds.

Now, let's find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence. Since we started with 6 storks and now have 11 birds, we can subtract the number of birds from the number of storks: 6 - 11 = -5.

The result is -5, which means there are 5 more storks than birds sitting on the fence.

Therefore, there are 5 more storks than birds sitting on the fence.

To calculate the total amount of money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling the t-shirts, we need to find the discounted price per t-shirt and then multiply it by the number of t-shirts sold.

The original price of each t-shirt is $51, and they offered a discount of $8 per t-shirt. Therefore, the discounted price per t-shirt is $51 - $8 = $43.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money made by multiplying the discounted price per t-shirt by the number of t-shirts sold:

Total amount = Discounted price per t-shirt * Number of t-shirts sold
Total amount = $43 * 130
Total amount = $5590

To find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we need to calculate the total number of drums of grapes filled per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Given that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day, we can calculate the number of drums filled by each picker per day by dividing the total number of drums by the number of pickers:

244 drums/day ÷ 294 pickers = 0.831 drum/picker/day

Now, to find the total number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days, we multiply the drums filled per day by the number of days:

Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?
Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Let's assume that Jackie has x apples. Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, Adam would have x + 4 apples.

Together, Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) = 14.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 4 = 14.

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we have: 2x = 10.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find: x = 5.

So, Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.

Now, let's find out how many apples Bob has. We know that Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, which is 9 + 5 + 6 = 20.

Therefore, Bob has 20 apples.

If you have any further questions or need more help, feel free to ask!

Bobby ate some pieces of candy. Then he ate 25 more. If he ate a total of 43 pieces of candy How many pieces of candy had he eaten at the start?
To solve this problem, let's use a variable to represent the number of pieces of candy Bobby had eaten at the start. Let's call this variable "x."

According to the problem, Bobby ate some pieces of candy and then ate 25 more. So, the total number of pieces of candy he ate can be expressed as x + 25.

We are given that the total number of pieces of candy Bobby ate is 43. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 25 = 43

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 25 from both sides:

x + 25 - 25 = 43 - 25

This simplifies to:

x = 18

Therefore, Bobby had eaten 18 pieces of candy at the start.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is18.

We know that Julia played tag with 16 kids on Monday. 

Now, let's assume that on Tuesday, Julia played tag with x number of kids. 

According to the problem, she played tag with 12 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday. 

So, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: 

16 = x + 12 

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: 

16 - 12 = x 

4 = x 

Therefore, Julia played tag with 4 kids on Tuesday.

To find out how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived, we need to determine the number of trees that survived the typhoon.

Haley initially had 3 trees, and after the typhoon, 13 trees died. Therefore, the total number of trees that were in her backyard before the typhoon is 3 + 13 = 16.

Since all the trees that died were part of the initial 16 trees, the number of trees that survived the typhoon is 16 - 13 = 3.

To calculate the difference between the number of trees that died and those that survived, we subtract the number of surviving trees from the number of trees that died: 13 - 3 = 10.

Therefore, 10 more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is10.

To solve this problem, we can use basic division. Matthew started with 24 crackers and gave an equal number of crackers to each of his 3 friends. Let's assume he gave x crackers to each friend.

So, the total number of crackers Matthew gave to his friends is 3x.

After giving away some crackers, Matthew had 17 crackers left. We can express this as an equation:

24 - 3x = 17

To find the value of x, we need to solve this equation.

Subtracting 17 from both sides of the equation, we get:

24 - 17 = 3x

7 = 3x

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3:

7/3 = x

Since we can't have a fraction of a cracker, we need to round our answer. In this case, we can round up to the nearest whole number because it's not possible to give a fraction of a cracker.

Therefore, Matthew gave each of his friends 3 crackers.

The Razorback shop makes $ 86 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 232 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?
To find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, we need to calculate the difference in their prices. 

The Razorback shop makes $86 off each t-shirt and $232 off each jersey. 

Let's start by finding the total revenue from selling t-shirts:
Revenue from t-shirts = Price per t-shirt × Number of t-shirts sold
Revenue from t-shirts = $86 × 254

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys:
Revenue from jerseys = Price per jersey × Number of jerseys sold
Revenue from jerseys = $232 × 43

Now, we can find the difference in revenue between jerseys and t-shirts:
Difference in revenue = Revenue from jerseys - Revenue from t-shirts

Substituting the values we calculated:
Difference in revenue = ($232 × 43) - ($86 × 254)

Calculating this expression will give us the difference in revenue between jerseys and t-shirts.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isDifference in revenue = ($232 × 43) - ($86 × 254)
Difference in revenue = $9976 - $21844

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Let's assume Doug had x marbles. So, Ed had x + 24 marbles.

2. Doug lost 27 marbles at the playground. Therefore, Doug's new total is x - 27 marbles.

3. Ed found 9 more marbles. So, Ed's new total is (x + 24) + 9 marbles, which simplifies to x + 33 marbles.

4. To find the difference in the number of marbles between Ed and Doug, we subtract Doug's new total from Ed's new total: (x + 33) - (x - 27).

Simplifying this expression, we get (x + 33 - x + 27), which further simplifies to 60.

Therefore, Ed had 60 more marbles than Doug after Doug lost 27 marbles and Ed found 9 more marbles.

Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework How many pages did she have to complete in all?
Let's solve the problem step by step. 

We know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework. Let's assume she had to complete x pages of reading homework.

According to the problem, Rachel had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework. So, the number of math homework pages is x + 3.

To find the total number of pages Rachel had to complete, we add the number of math homework pages and the number of reading homework pages:

Total pages = Math homework pages + Reading homework pages
Total pages = (x + 3) + x
Total pages = 2x + 3

Since we know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework, we can set up an equation:

8 = 2x + 3

Now, let's solve for x:

8 - 3 = 2x
5 = 2x
x = 5/2
x = 2.5

Since we can't have half pages, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 3 pages of reading homework.

To find the total number of pages Rachel had to complete in all, we substitute the value of x into the equation:

Total pages = 2x + 3
Total pages = 2(2.5) + 3
Total pages = 5 + 3
Total pages = 8

So, Rachel had to complete a total of 8 pages of homework.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isRachel had to complete a total of 8 pages of homework.

To find out how many action figures Jerry had initially on the shelf, we can use algebra. Let's assume the initial number of action figures on the shelf is represented by the variable "x."

According to the problem, Jerry added 7 more action figures to the shelf, making the total number of action figures 10. We can express this information in an equation:

x + 7 = 10

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides:

x + 7 - 7 = 10 - 7
x = 3

Therefore, Jerry initially had 3 action figures on the shelf.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isJerry initially had 3 action figures on the shelf.

Initially, Dave had 24 apps and 9 files, so the difference between the number of apps and files was:
24 apps - 9 files = 15 more apps than files

After deleting some apps and files, Dave had 5 files and 12 apps left. So, the difference between the number of apps and files now is:

Let's solve this problem step by step. Let's assume the number of campers who went rowing in the morning is "x."

According to the problem, 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, the total number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is 7.

The problem states that a total of 60 campers went rowing that day. Therefore, the sum of the campers who went rowing in the morning and afternoon should be equal to 60.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 7 = 60.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's subtract 7 from both sides:

x + 7 - 7 = 60 - 7,
x = 53.

Therefore, 53 campers went rowing in the morning.

To find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add compared to the cups of sugar, we first need to determine the difference between the two quantities.

The recipe calls for 10 cups of flour and she has already added 7 cups. Therefore, she needs to add 10 - 7 = 3 more cups of flour.

The recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar, and since she hasn't added any yet, she needs to add 2 cups of sugar.

Now, to find the difference between the two quantities, we subtract the cups of sugar from the cups of flour: 3 - 2 = 1.

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug before Ed lost 21 marbles, we need to subtract the initial number of marbles Doug had from the initial number of marbles Ed had.

Let's assume Doug had x marbles. According to the problem, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 30 marbles.

Now, we know that Ed lost 21 marbles and was left with 91 marbles. So, we can set up the equation:

(x + 30) - 21 = 91

Simplifying the equation, we have:

x + 30 - 21 = 91
x + 9 = 91

Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 91 - 9
x = 82

Therefore, Doug had 82 marbles initially.

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we subtract the initial number of marbles Doug had from the initial number of marbles Ed had:

Ed's initial marbles - Doug's initial marbles = (x + 30) - x = 30

So, Ed initially had 30 more marbles than Doug.

To find the depth of the water, we need to determine Dean's height first. Given that Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, we can calculate Dean's height as follows:

Dean's height = Ron's height - 6 feet

Now that we know Dean's height is 9 feet, we can find the depth of the water. The problem states that the depth is 9 times Dean's height, so:

Depth of water = 9 times Dean's height

Paul had 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had 66 books and 59 pens left. How many books did he sell in the garage sale?
To find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of books he had and the number of books he had left after the sale.

Initial number of books = 108
Number of books left after the sale = 66

Books sold = Initial number of books - Number of books left after the sale
Books sold = 108 - 66
Books sold = 42

Therefore, Paul sold 42 books in the garage sale.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is42.

Paul had 71 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 38 new ones. If he has 116 books now How many more books did he buy than he sold?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Paul initially had 71 books.
2. After selling some books in a garage sale, he bought 38 new ones.
3. Now, he has a total of 116 books.

To find out how many more books Paul bought than he sold, we need to determine the difference between the number of books he bought and the number of books he sold.

Let's denote the number of books Paul sold as "x." Therefore, the number of books he bought can be represented as "x + 38."

According to the problem, the total number of books Paul has now is 116. So, we can set up the equation:

71 - x + (x + 38) = 116

Simplifying the equation, we get:

71 + 38 = 116 + x

109 = 116 + x

To isolate "x," we subtract 116 from both sides:

109 - 116 = x

-7 = x

Therefore, Paul sold 7 books.

To find out how many more books Paul bought than he sold, we subtract the number of books sold from the number of books bought:

x + 38 - x = 38

So, Paul bought 38 more books than he sold.

Therefore, Paul bought 38 more books than he sold.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is38.

He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 76 sacks per day and discard 64 of them. How many oranges do they harvest per day if each sack contains 50 oranges?
To find out how many oranges are harvested per day, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested by the number of oranges in each sack.

Number of sacks harvested per day: 76
Number of sacks discarded per day: 64
Number of oranges in each sack: 50

To calculate the total number of oranges harvested per day, we subtract the discarded sacks from the total harvested sacks and then multiply by the number of oranges in each sack:

Total harvested sacks per day = 76 - 64 = 12
Total oranges harvested per day = Total harvested sacks per day * Number of oranges in each sack

Total oranges harvested per day = 12 * 50 = 600

Therefore, they harvest 600 oranges per day.

Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Nell initially had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards.
2. She gave some cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left.
3. Let's assume Nell gave x baseball cards and y Ace cards to Jeff.
4. After giving away x baseball cards, Nell has 309 - x baseball cards left.
5. Similarly, after giving away y Ace cards, Nell has 356 - y Ace cards left.
6. According to the problem, the total number of cards Nell has left is 415. So, we can write the equation:
   (309 - x) + (356 - y) = 415

Now, let's solve the equation to find the values of x and y:

309 - x + 356 - y = 415
665 - (x + y) = 415
665 - 415 = x + y
250 = x + y

Therefore, we know that x + y = 250.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has left:

(309 - x) - (356 - y) = (309 - 356) + (y - x)
= -47 + (y - x)
= y - x - 47

Since we know that x + y = 250, we can substitute this value into the equation:

y - x - 47 = 250 - 47
y - x - 47 = 203

Hence, Nell has 203 more baseball cards than Ace cards.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is203.

To find the number of books Frank read, we need to divide the total number of days it took him to finish all the books by the number of days it took him to finish each book.

Let's denote the number of books Frank read as "x". We know that each book has 66 pages, and it took him 12 days to finish each book. Therefore, the total number of days it took him to finish all the books can be calculated as 66 pages/book * 12 days/book = 792 pages.

We also know that it took Frank 492 days to finish all the books. So, we can set up the equation:

792 pages/book * x books = 492 days

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 792:

x = 492 days / (792 pages/book)

Now, let's calculate the value of x:

x = 0.62 books

Since we can't have a fraction of a book, we round the value of x to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Frank read approximately 1 book.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.
At the bus stop, 63 children got off the bus.
So, the number of children on the bus after the 63 got off is 5 - 63 = -58.

However, the problem states that there were 14 children altogether on the bus after some more got on. This means that the negative value (-58) must represent the number of children who got on the bus.

To find the number of children who got on the bus, we need to take the absolute value of -58, which is 58.

There are 20 houses in a block. If a mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each house in each block How many pieces of junk mail should he give each block?
To find out how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give each block, we need to multiply the number of houses in the block by the number of pieces of junk mail for each house.

Given that there are 20 houses in a block and the mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each house, we can calculate the total number of pieces of junk mail for the block as follows:

Total number of pieces of junk mail = Number of houses in the block × Number of pieces of junk mail for each house
Total number of pieces of junk mail = 20 houses × 32 pieces of junk mail per house
Total number of pieces of junk mail = 640 pieces of junk mail

Therefore, the mailman should give 640 pieces of junk mail to each block.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is640.

The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the total distance each animal jumped.

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so its total distance is 19 + 10 = 29 inches.
The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so its total distance is 29 + 20 = 49 inches.

To determine how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's distance from the mouse's distance: 49 - 19 = 30 inches.

Therefore, the mouse jumped 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.

They decided to hold the party in their backyard. If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs How many more chairs than tables do they have?
To find out how many more chairs than tables they have, we need to determine the total number of chairs and tables separately.

Given that there are 5 sets of tables, and each set has 10 chairs, we can calculate the total number of chairs as follows:

Total number of chairs = Number of sets of tables × Number of chairs per set
                      = 5 sets × 10 chairs per set
                      = 50 chairs

Since each set of tables has 1 table, the total number of tables is simply 5.

To find the difference between the number of chairs and tables, we subtract the number of tables from the number of chairs:

Difference = Total number of chairs - Total number of tables
           = 50 chairs - 5 tables
           = 45

Therefore, they have 45 more chairs than tables.

To find out how many kids she played with on Tuesday, we can subtract the number of kids she played with on Monday from the total number of kids she played with. 

Total number of kids Julia played with - Number of kids she played with on Monday = Number of kids she played with on Tuesday

18 - 4 = 14

Therefore, Julia played with 14 kids on Tuesday.

To find out how many more pastries than cakes the baker made, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes, and do the same for the pastries.

Total number of cakes made = 19
Total number of pastries made = 131

Number of cakes sold = 70
Number of pastries sold = 88

Number of pastries remaining = Total number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold
Number of pastries remaining = 131 - 88 = 43

Number of cakes remaining = Total number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold
Number of cakes remaining = 19 - 70 = -51

Since the number of cakes remaining is negative, it means that the baker sold more cakes than he made. Therefore, we cannot compare the number of pastries remaining to the number of cakes remaining.

However, if we consider only the number of pastries sold and cakes sold, we can find the difference:

Difference = Number of pastries sold - Number of cakes sold
Difference = 88 - 70 = 18

Therefore, the baker made 18 more pastries than cakes that were sold.

We know that John used a total of 11 nails to secure the large planks of wood. Additionally, he used an extra 8 nails. 

So, the total number of nails used is 11 + 8 = 19 nails.

Now, we are given that each plank needs 3 nails to be secured. 

To find the number of planks needed, we can divide the total number of nails used by the number of nails needed per plank:

19 nails ÷ 3 nails/plank = 6.33 planks.

Since we can't have a fraction of a plank, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John needs a minimum of 7 planks to secure the walls of the house.

2. Ed lost 17 marbles at the playground. So, the new number of marbles Ed has is (x + 29) - 17.

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug after losing 17 marbles, we need to subtract the number of marbles Doug had from the new number of marbles Ed has:

[(x + 29) - 17] - x

Simplifying this expression, we get:

x + 29 - 17 - x

The "x" terms cancel out, leaving us with:

29 - 17

Calculating this, we find that Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug after losing 17 marbles at the playground.

Let's assume the number of baskets of peaches is 'x'. 

In each basket, there are 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, which gives us a total of 4 + 3 = 7 peaches per basket. 

Since we have 'x' baskets, the total number of peaches will be 7x. 

According to the problem, the total number of peaches is 7. 

So, we can set up the equation:

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 7: 

x = 7/7

Carol was sending out birthday invitations to her friends. Each package of invitations she bought had 14 invitations in it and she bought 6 packs. Then she bought 11 extra invitations. How many friends can she invite?
To find out how many friends Carol can invite, we need to calculate the total number of invitations she has. 

First, let's determine the number of invitations in the packs she bought. Each pack contains 14 invitations, and she bought 6 packs. So, the total number of invitations in the packs is 14 x 6 = 84 invitations.

Next, we need to consider the additional 11 invitations she bought separately. 

To find the total number of invitations, we add the invitations from the packs and the extra invitations: 84 + 11 = 95 invitations.

Therefore, Carol can invite a total of 95 friends to her birthday party.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is95.

There were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. How many roses did she cut?
To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of roses and the current number of roses in the vase.

Initially, there were 15 roses in the vase, and now there are 17 roses. Therefore, Jessica added 17 - 15 = 2 roses to the vase.

Since Jessica only added roses and didn't cut any, the number of roses she cut is 0.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0. Jessica did not cut any roses.

Jerry had 9 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. If he also has 10 books on the shelf How many more action figures than books were on his shelf?
To find out how many more action figures than books were on Jerry's shelf, we need to subtract the number of books from the number of action figures.

Jerry initially had 9 action figures on the shelf, and he added 7 more. So the total number of action figures on the shelf is 9 + 7 = 16.

Now, we subtract the number of books, which is 10, from the total number of action figures, which is 16.

16 - 10 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 31 sacks of ripe oranges and 24 sacks of unripe oranges per day. How many sacks of unripe oranges will they have after 45 days of harvest?
To find out how many sacks of unripe oranges they will have after 45 days of harvest, we need to calculate the total number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Given that they harvest 24 sacks of unripe oranges per day, we can calculate the total number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested in 45 days as follows:

Total sacks of unripe oranges = 24 sacks/day * 45 days

Multiplying these values, we get:

Total sacks of unripe oranges = 1080 sacks

Therefore, after 45 days of harvest, they will have 1080 sacks of unripe oranges.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1080 sacks.

To find the depth of the water, we need to calculate Ron's height and then multiply it by 16.

Given that Ron stands at 13 feet, we can determine Dean's height by adding 9 feet to Ron's height: 13 + 9 = 22 feet.

Now, to find the depth of the water, we multiply Ron's height by 16: 13 * 16 = 208 feet.

Therefore, the depth of the water is 208 feet.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is208.

22 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 40 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 2 children altogether on the bus. How many children got off the bus at the bus stop?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 22 children on the bus.
Then, 40 children got on the bus at the bus stop.
So, the total number of children on the bus after the new children boarded is 22 + 40 = 62.

Now, we know that after some children got off the bus, there were only 2 children left.

To find out how many children got off the bus, we subtract the final number of children from the initial number of children on the bus.

62 (total) - 2 (remaining) = 60 children got off the bus at the bus stop.

Therefore, 60 children got off the bus at the bus stop.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is60.

The Razorback shop makes $ 192 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 34 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?
To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we need to calculate the difference in profit between the two items.

Profit from selling t-shirts = $192 x 157 = $30,144
Profit from selling jerseys = $34 x 19 = $646

To find the difference, we subtract the profit from selling jerseys from the profit from selling t-shirts:

$30,144 - $646 = $29,498

Therefore, a t-shirt costs $29,498 more than a jersey.

Allan initially brought 2 balloons and then bought 3 more at the park. So, Allan has a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons.

Jake brought 4 balloons to the park.

To find out how many more balloons Allan has than Jake, we subtract the number of balloons Jake has from the number of balloons Allan has.

Allan has 5 balloons, and Jake has 4 balloons.

To find out how many more customers stayed behind than those that left, we need to determine the difference between the number of customers who stayed and the number of customers who left.

If the waiter initially had 3 customers and still had 4 customers after some left, it means that only 1 customer left (3 - 1 = 2). Therefore, 2 customers stayed behind.

To find the number of pages in the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the total number of pages in the book.

The book has 2 chapters across 81 pages, so each chapter has an equal number of pages. To determine the number of pages in each chapter, we divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters: 81 pages / 2 chapters = 40.5 pages per chapter.

However, since we can't have half a page, we know that each chapter is not exactly 40.5 pages long. Instead, we can assume that both chapters have an equal number of pages, except for the second chapter, which may have a different length.

Since the second chapter is 68 pages long, we can conclude that the first chapter is also 68 pages long. Therefore, the second chapter has 68 pages.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is68 pages.

In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys How many boys are there in that school?
To find the number of boys in the school, we can subtract the given number of girls from the total number of students.

Total number of students = 697 girls + boys

We also know that there are 228 more girls than boys, so we can set up the following equation:

697 girls = boys + 228

To solve for the number of boys, we need to isolate the variable "boys" on one side of the equation. Let's rearrange the equation:

boys = 697 girls - 228

Now, substitute the given value of girls into the equation:

boys = 697 - 228

To solve this problem, let's use a simple equation. Let's assume that Danny initially had "x" bottle caps.

He threw away 60 old bottle caps, so the number of bottle caps he had after throwing them away is "x - 60".

He also found 58 new bottle caps, so the total number of bottle caps he had after finding them is "(x - 60) + 58".

According to the problem, Danny now has 67 bottle caps, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 60) + 58 = 67

Simplifying the equation, we have:

x - 60 + 58 = 67
x - 2 = 67
x = 67 + 2

To calculate how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to subtract his weekly rent from his weekly earnings and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the harvest season.

Lewis earns $491 every week, and he has to pay $216 in rent every week. So, his weekly savings can be calculated as:

Weekly savings = Earnings - Rent
Weekly savings = $491 - $216
Weekly savings = $275

Now, we need to multiply his weekly savings by the number of weeks in the harvest season, which is 1181:

Total savings = Weekly savings x Number of weeks

Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games, so her total number of games is 57 + 39 = 96 games.

Her friends have 34 new games.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has: 96 - 34 = 62.

Therefore, Katie has 62 more games than her friends.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is62.

Paul had 51 books and 106 pens. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had 82 books and 14 pens left. How many pens did he sell in the garage sale?
To find out how many pens Paul sold in the garage sale, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of pens he had and the number of pens he had left after the sale.

Initial number of pens = 106
Number of pens left after the sale = 14

Pens sold = Initial number of pens - Number of pens left after the sale
Pens sold = 106 - 14
Pens sold = 92

Therefore, Paul sold 92 pens in the garage sale.

36 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 36 children on the bus.
At the bus stop, 68 children got off the bus.
So, the number of children remaining on the bus after the 68 got off is 36 - 68 = -32.

However, the problem states that there were 12 children altogether on the bus after some more got on.
To find out how many more children got on the bus, we need to determine the difference between the current number of children on the bus (12) and the number of children remaining after the 68 got off (-32).

12 - (-32) = 12 + 32 = 44.

Therefore, 44 more children got on the bus than those who got off.

So, the number of children who got off the bus than those who got on is 68 - 44 = 24.

Hence, 24 more children got off the bus than those who got on.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is24.

Edward spent $ 9. Then he spent $ 8 more. Now he has $ 17. How much did Edward have before he spent his money?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Edward initially had a certain amount of money, which we'll call "x" dollars.

He spent $9, so he had x - 9 dollars remaining.

Then he spent $8 more, which means he had (x - 9) - 8 dollars left.

Now we know that he has $17, so we can set up an equation:

(x - 9) - 8 = 17

Simplifying the equation, we have:

x - 17 = 17

Adding 17 to both sides, we get:

x = 34

Therefore, Edward had $34 before he spent his money.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is34.

For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 10 small planks. If large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails. How many nails does John need for the house wall?
To find out how many nails John needs for the house wall, we need to calculate the total number of nails required for the large planks and the small planks separately, and then add them together.

The number of nails needed for the large planks can be found by multiplying the number of large planks (12) by the number of nails needed for each large plank (15). So, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is 12 * 15 = 180 nails.

Similarly, the number of nails needed for the small planks can be found by multiplying the number of small planks (10) by the number of nails needed for each small plank (5). So, the total number of nails needed for the small planks is 10 * 5 = 50 nails.

To find the total number of nails needed for the house wall, we add the number of nails needed for the large planks and the small planks together: 180 + 50 = 230 nails.

Therefore, John needs 230 nails for the house wall.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is230.

To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of books and the number of action figures on Jerry's shelf.

Initially, Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books on the shelf, so the number of books minus the number of action figures is:
10 books - 2 action figures = 8

Later, Jerry added 4 more action figures to the shelf. Now, the total number of action figures is:
2 initial action figures + 4 added action figures = 6 action figures

Therefore, the number of books minus the number of action figures after the addition is:
8 books - 6 action figures = 2

So, there are 2 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf.

In a school there are 868 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 281 more girls than boys How many pupils are there in that school?
To solve this problem, let's assume the number of boys in the school is "x." 

Given that there are 868 girls, we can express the number of girls as "x + 281" since there are 281 more girls than boys.

Now, to find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to add the number of boys and girls together.

Total number of pupils = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of pupils = x + (x + 281)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
Total number of pupils = 2x + 281

Since we know that the total number of pupils in the school is 868 (given in the problem), we can set up the equation:

2x + 281 = 868

Now, let's solve for x:

2x = 868 - 281
2x = 587
x = 587 / 2
x = 293.5

Since we can't have half a student, we can conclude that there are 293 boys in the school.

To find the total number of pupils, we can substitute the value of x back into the equation:

Total number of pupils = 2x + 281
Total number of pupils = 2(293) + 281
Total number of pupils = 586 + 281
Total number of pupils = 867

Therefore, there are 867 pupils in that school.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is867.

To find out how much money the Razorback shop made from selling the jerseys, we need to multiply the number of jerseys sold by the profit made per jersey.

Profit per jersey = $165
Number of jerseys sold = 156

Total money made from selling jerseys = Profit per jersey × Number of jerseys sold
Total money made from selling jerseys = $165 × 156

Let's assume that Haley initially grew x trees.

After the typhoon, 5 trees died, so we subtract 5 from the initial number of trees:

x - 5

We know that after the typhoon, 12 trees were left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 12

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5

This simplifies to:

x = 17

Therefore, Haley initially grew 17 trees in her backyard.

Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 36 of the pickers that they fill 8 drums of grapes per day. How many days will it take to fill 240 drums of grapes?
To solve this problem, we can use a simple multiplication equation. 

If 36 pickers can fill 8 drums of grapes per day, we can find out how many drums of grapes they fill in one day by multiplying the number of pickers by the number of drums filled by each picker. 

So, 36 pickers * 8 drums per picker = 288 drums filled per day.

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take to fill 240 drums of grapes. We can divide the total number of drums by the number of drums filled per day.

240 drums / 288 drums per day = 0.8333 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take 1 day to fill 240 drums of grapes with 36 pickers.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1 day.

There were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 4 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 23 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?
Let's break down the information given in the problem. Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 4 roses, leaving us with 2 - 4 = -2 roses. However, we cannot have a negative number of roses, so we need to consider this as a deficit of roses.

To make up for the deficit, Jessica cut some new roses from her garden and added them to the vase. Let's say she cut x roses. So, the total number of roses in the vase after adding the new ones would be -2 + x.

According to the problem, there are now 23 roses in the vase. Therefore, we can set up the equation -2 + x = 23 to represent the situation.

To find the value of x, we can solve this equation by isolating x. Adding 2 to both sides of the equation, we get x = 23 + 2 = 25.

So, Jessica cut 25 roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is25.

Each set of tables has 3 chairs, and since they have 4 sets of tables, the total number of chairs they currently have is 4 sets * 3 chairs/set = 12 chairs.

Since 14 people will attend the party, and they already have 12 chairs, we can subtract the number of chairs they have from the number of chairs they need. 

Number of chairs they need = Total number of people - Number of chairs they have
Number of chairs they need = 14 people - 12 chairs
Number of chairs they need = 2 chairs

Therefore, they will need to buy 2 more chairs for the party.

According to the problem, Jack received a total of 5 emails in the day. So, we can write an equation to represent this:

4 (emails in the morning) + x (emails in the afternoon) = 5 (total emails in the day)

Now, let's solve for x:

4 + x = 5

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 5 - 4

To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of salt Mary needs to add, we first need to determine the amount of flour she has already added and the amount of salt she needs to add.

Given:
Sugar needed = 9 cups
Flour needed = 7 cups
Salt needed = 4 cups

Flour already added = 2 cups

To find the remaining flour needed, we subtract the flour already added from the total flour needed:
Remaining flour needed = Flour needed - Flour already added
Remaining flour needed = 7 cups - 2 cups
Remaining flour needed = 5 cups

Now, to find the difference between the remaining flour needed and the salt needed, we subtract the salt needed from the remaining flour needed:
Difference = Remaining flour needed - Salt needed
Difference = 5 cups - 4 cups
Difference = 1 cup

Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour than cups of salt.

To find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in each day, we need to divide the total number of drums filled by the number of days.

Given that 266 pickers fill 90 drums of grapes in 5 days, we can set up a proportion:

266 pickers / 5 days = x drums / 1 day

To solve for x (the number of drums filled in each day), we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

266 * 1 = 5 * x
266 = 5x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

266 / 5 = x
53.2 = x

Therefore, approximately 53.2 drums of grapes would be filled in each day. Since we can't have a fraction of a drum, we can round it down to 53 drums per day.

Baker made 121 cakes. He sold 105 of them and bought 170 new cakes. How many cakes does baker still have?
To find out how many cakes the baker still has, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the initial number of cakes and then add the number of new cakes bought.

Initial number of cakes = 121
Cakes sold = 105
New cakes bought = 170

To calculate the remaining cakes, we can follow these steps:

1. Subtract the number of cakes sold from the initial number of cakes:
121 - 105 = 16

2. Add the number of new cakes bought to the result:
16 + 170 = 186

Therefore, the baker still has 186 cakes.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is186.

Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. If Jake brought 4 more balloons than the number of balloons that Allan brought How many balloons did Allan bring to the park?
Let's solve this problem step by step. We know that Jake brought 6 balloons to the park, and he brought 4 more balloons than Allan. 

Let's assume the number of balloons Allan brought is 'x'. 

According to the problem, Jake brought 4 more balloons than Allan, so Jake brought x + 4 balloons. 

We also know that Jake brought 6 balloons. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 

x + 4 = 6 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get: 

x = 6 - 4 

x = 2 

So, Allan brought 2 balloons to the park.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isAllan brought 2 balloons to the park.

The school is planning a field trip. The school has 66 classrooms. There are 102 students in the school and 8 seats on each school bus. If 22 students do n't want to go for the trip How many buses are needed to take the trip?
To determine the number of buses needed for the field trip, we need to calculate the total number of students who want to go on the trip after subtracting the 22 students who don't want to go.

Total number of students who want to go = Total number of students - Students who don't want to go
Total number of students who want to go = 102 - 22 = 80 students

Now, we can calculate the number of buses needed by dividing the total number of students who want to go by the number of seats on each bus.

Number of buses needed = Total number of students who want to go / Number of seats on each bus
Number of buses needed = 80 / 8 = 10 buses

Therefore, 10 buses are needed to take the field trip.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is10.

Debby bought 95 soda bottles and 180 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 15 water bottles and 54 soda bottles a day How many days would the water bottles last?
To find out how many days the water bottles would last, we need to determine the total number of water bottles remaining after Debby drinks 15 bottles each day.

Debby bought 180 water bottles, and she drinks 15 bottles each day. So, the number of water bottles remaining after each day would be:

180 - 15 = 165 (after day 1)
165 - 15 = 150 (after day 2)
150 - 15 = 135 (after day 3)
And so on...

We can observe that the number of water bottles remaining decreases by 15 each day. To find the number of days the water bottles would last, we divide the initial number of water bottles (180) by the rate at which they are consumed (15 per day):

180 / 15 = 12

Therefore, the water bottles would last for 12 days.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is12 days.

Initially, there are 6 storks and 2 birds sitting on the fence. So, the total number of storks and birds is 6 + 2 = 8.

Then, 3 more birds join them. Adding these 3 birds to the existing 2 birds gives us a total of 2 + 3 = 5 birds.

Now, let's compare the number of storks and birds. We have 6 storks and 5 birds.

To find the difference between the number of storks and birds, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks: 6 - 5 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 more stork than bird sitting on the fence.

After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day?
To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day, we can use the given information. 

We know that within the past 327 days, 406 people visited the palace. So, on average, the number of visitors per day would be 406 divided by 327:

Average visitors per day = 406 / 327

Now, to find the number of visitors on the previous day, we can subtract the average visitors per day from the total number of visitors on the current day:

Visitors on the previous day = Total visitors on the current day - Average visitors per day

Visitors on the previous day = 132 - (406 / 327)

Now, let's calculate the value:

Visitors on the previous day = 132 - (406 / 327)
Visitors on the previous day ≈ 132 - 1.242
Visitors on the previous day ≈ 130.758

Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we round the number to the nearest whole number:

Visitors on the previous day ≈ 131

Therefore, approximately 131 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day.

Edward spent $6 on books and $16 on pens, so his total expenses are $6 + $16 = $22.

After spending this amount, he has $19 left. We can express this as:

x - $22 = $19

To solve for 'x', we can add $22 to both sides of the equation:

x - $22 + $22 = $19 + $22

This simplifies to:

x = $41

Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many crackers and cakes each person ate when Matthew distributed them equally among his 28 friends.

First, let's find the total number of crackers and cakes Matthew had initially:
Crackers: 13
Cakes: 15

Since Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend, we can divide the total number of crackers and cakes by the number of friends (28) to find out how many each person received.

Crackers per person: 13 / 28 = 0.464 (rounded to three decimal places)
Cakes per person: 15 / 28 = 0.536 (rounded to three decimal places)

Since we can't have a fraction of a cracker or cake, we'll round these values to the nearest whole number.

Crackers per person: 0 (rounded down from 0.464)
Cakes per person: 1 (rounded up from 0.536)

Therefore, each person ate 0 crackers and 1 cake.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isEach person ate 0 crackers and 1 cake.

A waiter had some customers. After 9 customers left he still had 12 customers. How many customers did he have at the start?
To solve this problem, let's use a variable to represent the number of customers the waiter had at the start. Let's call this variable "x".

According to the problem, after 9 customers left, the waiter still had 12 customers. This can be expressed as:

x - 9 = 12

To find the value of x, we can solve this equation by isolating x on one side. Adding 9 to both sides of the equation, we get:

x - 9 + 9 = 12 + 9
x = 21

Therefore, the waiter had 21 customers at the start.

Kelly has 80 nintendo games. She found 31 more nintendo games. How many does she need to give away so that she will have 6 games left?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Kelly starts with 80 Nintendo games.
2. She finds an additional 31 Nintendo games.
3. So, her total number of Nintendo games becomes 80 + 31 = 111 games.

Now, let's determine how many games Kelly needs to give away to have 6 games left:

Let's assume she needs to give away x games.

After giving away x games, she will have 111 - x games left.

According to the problem, she wants to have 6 games left, so we can set up the equation:

111 - x = 6

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

111 - 6 = x
105 = x

Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 105 Nintendo games in order to have 6 games left.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is105.

Robin cut off 20 inches of his hair. If his hair is now 10 inches long How long was his hair before he cut?
To find out how long Robin's hair was before he cut off 20 inches, we can use a simple equation. Let's denote the initial length of his hair as "x" inches.

According to the problem, Robin cut off 20 inches, so the remaining length of his hair is x - 20 inches. We are given that this remaining length is 10 inches.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x - 20 = 10

To solve for x, we can add 20 to both sides of the equation:
x - 20 + 20 = 10 + 20
x = 30

Hence, Robin's hair was initially 30 inches long before he cut off 20 inches.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is30 inches.

You had 26 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 15 candies and 52 cookies in total How many cookies does each bag have?
To find out how many cookies each bag has, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's assume the number of cookies in each bag is represented by 'x'.

Since you had 26 bags with an equal number of cookies, the total number of cookies can be calculated by multiplying the number of bags (26) by the number of cookies in each bag (x). This can be expressed as:

26x

We also know that you had 15 candies and 52 cookies in total. So, we can set up another equation:

15 + 52 = 26x

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of 'x'.

15 + 52 = 26x
67 = 26x

To isolate 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 26:

67/26 = x

Calculating this, we find:

x ≈ 2.577

Therefore, each bag has approximately 2.577 cookies. Since we can't have a fraction of a cookie, we can say that each bag has 2 cookies, with some leftover cookies remaining.

Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 14 = 16.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get: x = 16 - 14.

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we have: x = 2.

So, Julia played with 2 kids on Monday.

Jessie weighed 114 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 50 kilograms in the first week and 60 kilograms in the second week. How much does she weigh now?
To find out how much Jessie weighs now, we need to subtract the total weight she lost from her initial weight.

Initial weight: 114 kilograms
Weight lost in the first week: 50 kilograms
Weight lost in the second week: 60 kilograms

To calculate her current weight, we subtract the total weight lost from her initial weight:

Current weight = Initial weight - Weight lost in the first week - Weight lost in the second week
Current weight = 114 kg - 50 kg - 60 kg
Current weight = 4 kg

Therefore, Jessie now weighs 4 kilograms.

He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 8 sacks per day. How many days will it take to harvest 24 sacks of oranges?
To find out how many days it will take to harvest 24 sacks of oranges, we can set up a simple equation. 

Let's assume that the number of days required to harvest 24 sacks of oranges is represented by 'd'. We know that they harvest 8 sacks per day. 

So, the equation becomes:
8 sacks/day × d days = 24 sacks

To solve for 'd', we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:
d = 24 sacks / 8 sacks/day

Simplifying the equation, we get:
d = 3 days

Therefore, it will take 3 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

To find out how many more bottles than apples the grocery store had, we need to calculate the total number of bottles and then subtract the number of apples.

The total number of bottles is the sum of regular soda bottles and diet soda bottles:
72 (regular soda) + 32 (diet soda) = 104 bottles

Now, to determine the difference between the number of bottles and the number of apples:
104 (bottles) - 78 (apples) = 26

Therefore, the grocery store had 26 more bottles than apples.

Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. He ate some pieces of candy. Then he ate 5 more. If he still has 8 pieces of candy left How many pieces of candy had he eaten at the start?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Bobby had 22 pieces of candy.
Let's assume he ate x pieces of candy initially.

After eating some pieces of candy, he ate 5 more.
So, the total number of pieces of candy he ate is x + 5.

If he still has 8 pieces of candy left, we can set up the equation:
22 - (x + 5) = 8

Simplifying the equation:
22 - x - 5 = 8
17 - x = 8

To isolate x, we subtract 17 from both sides:
17 - x - 17 = 8 - 17
-x = -9

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x:
(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-9)
x = 9

Therefore, Bobby had eaten 9 pieces of candy at the start.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isBobby had eaten 9 pieces of candy at the start.

In each basket, there are 10 red peaches and 18 green peaches. So, the total number of peaches in each basket is 10 + 18 = 28.

Since there are 11 baskets, we can multiply the number of peaches in each basket (28) by the number of baskets (11) to find the total number of peaches.

28 peaches/basket * 11 baskets = 308 peaches

Therefore, there are 308 peaches in the baskets altogether.

Let's denote the number of push-ups Zachary did as 'Z'. According to the information given, we can set up the equation:

Z + 9 = 44

To solve for Z, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 9 from both sides:

Z + 9 - 9 = 44 - 9

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She already put in 11 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?
To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour Mary needs to add now, we first need to determine how many cups of sugar she has already added. 

According to the recipe, Mary needs 5 cups of sugar and has not mentioned adding any yet. Therefore, she has added 0 cups of sugar so far.

Next, we calculate the difference between the cups of sugar and the cups of flour she needs to add. 

Cups of sugar needed = 5 cups
Cups of flour needed = 14 cups

Cups of sugar already added = 0 cups
Cups of flour already added = 11 cups

To find the difference, we subtract the cups of flour already added from the cups of flour needed:

Difference = Cups of flour needed - Cups of flour already added
Difference = 14 cups - 11 cups
Difference = 3 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar than cups of flour to complete the recipe correctly.

Let's solve this math problem step by step. 

We know that Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds together. Let's represent the weight of Marco's strawberries as 'x' pounds. So, the weight of his dad's strawberries would be (22 - x) pounds, as the total weight is 22 pounds.

On the way back, Marco's dad found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. So, the total weight of Marco's strawberries became (x + 30) pounds, and the total weight of all the strawberries became (22 - x) + (x + 30) = 36 pounds.

Simplifying the equation, we have 22 + 30 = 36.

Every day Ryan spends 5 hours on learning chinese and some more hours on learning english. If he spends 2 hours more on learning english than on learning chinese How many hours does he spend on learning english?
Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Let's assume that Ryan spends x hours on learning Chinese. 

According to the problem, Ryan spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese. So, the time he spends on learning English would be x + 2 hours. 

Now, we know that Ryan spends a total of 5 hours on learning Chinese and English combined. 

Therefore, the equation becomes: 

x + (x + 2) = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

2x + 2 = 5

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we have: 

2x = 3

Dividing both sides by 2, we find: 

x = 3/2

So, Ryan spends 3/2 hours (or 1.5 hours) on learning Chinese. 

To find the time he spends on learning English, we substitute this value back into the equation: 

x + 2 = 1.5 + 2 = 3.5

Therefore, Ryan spends 3.5 hours on learning English.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.5 hours.

Lewis earns $ 2 every week during the harvest. If he earns a total of $ 178 How many weeks did the harvest last?
To find out how many weeks the harvest lasted, we can set up an equation. Let's assume the number of weeks is represented by 'w'.

Since Lewis earns $2 every week, the total amount he earns can be calculated by multiplying the number of weeks by $2:

Total earnings = $2/week * number of weeks

According to the problem, the total earnings are $178. So we can write the equation as:

$178 = $2/week * w

To solve for 'w', we can divide both sides of the equation by $2:

$178 / $2 = w

This simplifies to:

89 = w

Therefore, the harvest lasted for 89 weeks.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is89 weeks.

Let's solve the problem step by step. 

We know that Paul initially had 2 books. After selling some books, he bought 150 new ones. So, the number of books he had after the garage sale is 2 - x + 150, where x represents the number of books he sold.

According to the problem, Paul now has 58 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2 - x + 150 = 58

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's simplify the equation:

Now, let's isolate x by subtracting 152 from both sides:

152 - 152 - x = 58 - 152

This simplifies to:

-x = -94

To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-94)

This gives us:

x = 94

Therefore, Paul sold 94 books in the garage sale.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is94.

To calculate the total amount of money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling the t-shirts, we need to find the total cost of the 14 t-shirts sold.

The original price of each t-shirt is $201. However, during the game, the price increased by $217 per t-shirt. So, the new price per t-shirt is $201 + $217 = $418.

To find the total amount of money made, we multiply the new price per t-shirt by the number of t-shirts sold:

Total amount = Price per t-shirt × Number of t-shirts sold
Total amount = $418 × 14
Total amount = $5852

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $5852 from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.

Paul initially had 21 books.
He sold some books in a garage sale.
After the garage sale, he bought 42 new books.
Now, he has 15 books.

To find out how many more books Paul sold than he bought, we need to calculate the difference between the number of books he sold and the number of books he bought.

Let's denote the number of books Paul sold as "x."

Initially, Paul had 21 books, so after selling "x" books, he would have 21 - x books left.
After buying 42 new books, his total number of books would be (21 - x) + 42.

According to the problem, Paul now has 15 books, so we can set up the equation:

(21 - x) + 42 = 15

Simplifying the equation:

21 - x + 42 = 15
63 - x = 15

Now, let's solve for "x":

63 - 15 = x
48 = x

Therefore, Paul sold 48 books.

To find out how many more books he sold than he bought, we subtract the number of books he bought (42) from the number of books he sold (48):

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. She already put in 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
To find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, we first need to determine the difference between the total cups of flour required and the cups of flour she has already added.

The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour, and Mary has already added 5 cups. Therefore, she still needs to add 14 - 5 = 9 cups of flour.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the cups of flour and the cups of sugar. The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar, so the difference between the cups of flour and sugar is 9 - 6 = 3 cups.

Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

To find out how many weeks the harvest lasted, we can divide the total earnings by the amount earned per week.

Let's denote the number of weeks as "w".

We know that Lewis earns $16 each week, so the total earnings can be expressed as:

Total earnings = Amount earned per week × Number of weeks
$1216 = $16 × w

To find the value of "w", we can divide both sides of the equation by $16:

$1216 / $16 = w
76 = w

Therefore, the harvest lasted for 76 weeks.

To find out how many minutes the machine worked yesterday, we need to determine the number of shirts it produced and divide that by the production rate.

The machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 44 shirts today, so the total number of shirts produced is 9 + 44 = 53 shirts.

Since the machine can make 3 shirts per minute, we can divide the total number of shirts by the production rate to find the number of minutes worked. Therefore, 53 shirts / 3 shirts per minute = 17.67 minutes.

However, since we're dealing with time, we can't have a fraction of a minute. Therefore, we round up to the nearest whole number. Thus, the machine worked for approximately 18 minutes yesterday.

To find out how many eggs Rebecca has, we can use a simple mathematical equation. Let's denote the total number of eggs as "x".

According to the problem, Rebecca wants to split the eggs into groups of 11, with each group having 2 eggs. This means that the number of eggs in each group is 2.

So, we can set up the equation:

2 * number of groups = total number of eggs

Since each group has 2 eggs, the number of groups is equal to the total number of eggs divided by 2:

number of groups = x / 2

And we know that the number of groups is 11:

x / 2 = 11

To find the value of x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 11 * 2

x = 22

Therefore, Rebecca has a total of 22 eggs.

Rachel picked 2 ripe apples from her tree. Now the tree has 7 apples still on it. If 6 of those are ripe and the rest are unripe How many ripe apples did the tree have to begin with?
To find out how many ripe apples the tree had to begin with, we can use the information given. 

We know that Rachel picked 2 ripe apples, and the tree now has 7 apples remaining. Out of those 7 apples, 6 are ripe, and the rest are unripe.

So, if 6 out of the 7 remaining apples are ripe, we can subtract those 6 from the total number of apples to find the number of unripe apples. 

7 - 6 = 1

Therefore, the tree originally had 6 + 1 = 7 ripe apples.

In a school there are 700 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 142 more boys than girls How many pupils are there in that school?
Let's solve this math problem step by step.

We know that there are 700 girls in the school. Let's represent the number of boys as "B."

According to the problem, there are 142 more boys than girls. This can be written as:

B = 700 + 142

Simplifying this equation, we find:

B = 842

Now, to find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to add the number of girls and boys together:

Total number of pupils = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of pupils = 700 + 842
Total number of pupils = 1542

Therefore, there are 1542 pupils in that school.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1542.

Robin has some packages of gum. There are 7 pieces in each package. Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. In all the number of pieces of gums robin has is 41. How many packages does Robin have?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of packages Robin has is "x".

We know that there are 7 pieces in each package, so the total number of pieces in the packages would be 7x.

Additionally, Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum, so we add 6 to the total number of pieces.

According to the problem, the total number of pieces of gum Robin has is 41.

Putting it all together, we can create the equation:

7x + 6 = 41

Now, let's solve for x:

Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:

7x = 41 - 6
7x = 35

Dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 35 / 7
x = 5

Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isRobin has 5 packages of gum.

Initially, the school had 632 girls and 410 boys. So the total number of girls was 632 + 465 = 1097 girls.

Now, to find the difference between the number of girls and boys, we subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 1097 - 410 = 687.

Therefore, the school now has 687 more girls than boys.

The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?
Let's solve this problem step by step. 

We know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 

Now, let's assume the distance the frog jumped as 'x' inches. 

According to the problem, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. So, the grasshopper's jump distance is x + 4 inches. 

Additionally, the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog. Therefore, the mouse's jump distance is x - 44 inches. 

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for the frog's jump distance: 

x + (x + 4) + (x - 44) = Total distance 

Simplifying the equation: 

3x - 40 = Total distance 

Since we don't have the total distance mentioned in the problem, we can't find the exact value of x. However, we can still determine the frog's jump distance in terms of x. 

Therefore, the frog jumped x inches.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isThe frog jumped x inches.

They decided to hold the party in their backyard. They have 14 chairs for each set of table. If they have 9 sets of tables How many more chairs than tables do they have?
To find out how many more chairs than tables they have, we need to determine the total number of chairs and tables separately.

The number of chairs can be calculated by multiplying the number of chairs per set of tables (14) by the number of sets of tables (9):

Number of chairs = 14 chairs/set × 9 sets = 126 chairs

Therefore, they have a total of 126 chairs.

Since they have 9 sets of tables, the number of tables is simply 9.

To find the difference between the number of chairs and tables, we subtract the number of tables from the number of chairs:

Difference = Number of chairs - Number of tables = 126 chairs - 9 tables = 117

Therefore, they have 117 more chairs than tables.

Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?
To find the number of students who participated in suggesting new food items, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon from the total number of students.

Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes = 450
Number of students who suggested bacon = 38

Total number of students who participated = Total number of students - Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes - Number of students who suggested bacon

Total number of students = 450 (students who suggested mashed potatoes) + 38 (students who suggested bacon) + Number of students who did not participate

Since the total number of choices was 66, and we know that 450 students suggested mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested bacon, we can calculate the number of students who did not participate:

Number of students who did not participate = Total number of choices - Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes - Number of students who suggested bacon
Number of students who did not participate = 66 - 450 - 38
Number of students who did not participate = -422

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the distance the frog jumped is "x" inches. According to the problem, the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump is x + 25 inches.

Now, the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's jump is x - 16 inches.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 21 inches, we can set up an equation:

x + 25 = 21 + x - 16

Simplifying the equation, we can cancel out the "x" terms:

25 = 21 - 16

25 = 5

This equation is not possible since 25 cannot equal 5. Therefore, there seems to be an error in the problem statement or the given information.

Let's denote Marco's dad's strawberries' weight as "D". We know that Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds, and the combined weight of both their strawberries was 37 pounds.

So, we can set up the equation: D + 15 = 37.

To isolate D, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

D = 37 - 15.

To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 57 days, we need to consider the number of visitors on each day.

On the first day, there were 557 visitors.
On the second day, there were 188 visitors.

We can observe that the number of visitors on each day follows a pattern. Let's calculate the number of visitors on the third day:

557 visitors on the first day + 188 visitors on the second day = 745 visitors on the third day.

We can see that the number of visitors increases by 557 each day. So, to find the total number of visitors within 57 days, we can multiply the number of days by the increase in visitors per day and add the initial number of visitors:

Total visitors = (Number of days - 1) * Increase in visitors per day + Initial number of visitors
Total visitors = (57 - 1) * 557 + 188

Calculating this expression:

Total visitors = 56 * 557 + 188
Total visitors = 31292 + 188
Total visitors = 31480

Therefore, within 57 days, a total of 31,480 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace.

The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 39 inches. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the mouse jump?
To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the distances jumped by each animal. Let's say the distance jumped by the frog is F inches.

According to the problem, the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's distance is F + 19 inches.

The mouse, on the other hand, jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's distance is F - 12 inches.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 39 inches, we can set up the equation:

F + 19 + F - 12 = 39

Combining like terms, we have:

2F + 7 = 39

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

2F = 32

Dividing both sides by 2:

F = 16

Emily is making bead necklaces for her friends. She had 2 beads and she was able to make 32 necklaces. How many beads did each necklace need?
To find out how many beads each necklace needs, we can divide the total number of beads by the number of necklaces. In this case, Emily had 2 beads and made 32 necklaces.

Number of beads ÷ Number of necklaces = Beads per necklace

2 beads ÷ 32 necklaces = 0.0625 beads per necklace

The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?
To determine the number of buses needed for the field trip, we need to find out how many students can fit on each bus and then divide the total number of students by that number.

Since each bus has 2 seats, we can assume that each bus can accommodate 2 students. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of buses required.

The total number of students in the school is 58, and since each classroom has the same number of students, we can divide 58 by the number of classrooms (87) to find the number of students per classroom.

58 students ÷ 87 classrooms = 0.6667 students per classroom (rounded to four decimal places)

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each classroom will have 1 student.

Now, we divide the total number of students (58) by the number of students per bus (2) to find the number of buses needed.

58 students ÷ 2 students per bus = 29 buses

So, 29 buses are needed to take the field trip.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is29 buses.

Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds. On the way back Marco ' dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?
To solve this problem, let's assume that Marco's strawberries weigh "x" pounds after his dad lost 8 pounds. We know that the total weight of strawberries collected was 36 pounds. 

So, we can set up the equation: x + 12 = 36

To find the weight of Marco's strawberries, we need to isolate "x" on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get: x = 36 - 12

Simplifying, we find that x = 24 pounds. 

Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed 24 pounds after his dad lost 8 pounds. 

To find his dad's strawberries' weight, we can subtract Marco's strawberries' weight from the initial total weight: 

Dad's strawberries' weight = Total weight - Marco's strawberries' weight
Dad's strawberries' weight = 36 - 24
Dad's strawberries' weight = 12 pounds

So, his dad's strawberries weighed 12 pounds after losing 8 pounds.

To find out how many sacks of oranges they will have after 26 days of harvest, we need to calculate the total number of ripe and unripe oranges harvested each day and then multiply it by the number of days.

The number of ripe oranges harvested per day is 28 sacks, and the number of unripe oranges harvested per day is 52 sacks. So, the total number of sacks harvested per day is 28 + 52 = 80 sacks.

To find the total number of sacks after 26 days, we multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of days: 80 sacks/day * 26 days = 2080 sacks.

Therefore, after 26 days of harvest, they will have a total of 2080 sacks of oranges.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2080 sacks.

To find out how many emails Jack received in the evening, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon and morning from the total number of emails he received in the day.

Total emails received = Emails received in the afternoon + Emails received in the morning + Emails received in the evening

Given:
Total emails received = 10
Emails received in the afternoon = 3
Emails received in the morning = 6

Let's substitute these values into the equation:

10 = 3 + 6 + Emails received in the evening

To solve for the number of emails received in the evening, we can rearrange the equation:

Emails received in the evening = Total emails received - Emails received in the afternoon - Emails received in the morning

Emails received in the evening = 10 - 3 - 6
Emails received in the evening = 1

We know that Steven has 18 peaches.

Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we subtract 12 from Steven's number of peaches: 18 - 12 = 6 peaches.

Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. Let's denote Jill's number of peaches as "x." So, Steven's number of peaches is x + 8.

Since we know that Steven has 18 peaches, we can set up an equation: x + 8 = 18.

To find Jill's number of peaches, we need to solve this equation. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we have x = 10.

Therefore, Jill has 10 peaches.

To find out how many bird families were left near the mountain, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the total number of bird families that came from the arctic.

Total number of bird families near the mountain = Initial number of bird families + Bird families from the arctic - Bird families that flew away

Given:
Initial number of bird families near the mountain = 3
Bird families from the arctic = 26
Bird families that flew away = 2

Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. If 218 students suggested adding mashed potatoes as well as bacon while 351 suggested adding only bacon to the menu How many students suggested adding bacon?
To find the number of students who suggested adding bacon, we can subtract the number of students who suggested adding both mashed potatoes and bacon from the total number of students who suggested adding only bacon.

Let's denote:
A = Number of students who suggested adding both mashed potatoes and bacon
B = Number of students who suggested adding only bacon

According to the given information:
A = 218 (students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon)
B = 351 (students who suggested adding only bacon)

To find the number of students who suggested adding bacon, we need to subtract A from B:
B - A = 351 - 218 = 133

Therefore, 133 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is133.

After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height. Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron. If Ron stands at 12 feet How deep was the water?
To find out the depth of the water, we need to calculate Ron's height and then multiply it by 5.

Given that Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron, we can determine Dean's height by subtracting 11 from Ron's height:

Ron's height = 12 feet
Dean's height = Ron's height - 11 feet = 12 feet - 11 feet = 1 foot

Now, we know that the depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height. So, we multiply Ron's height by 5:

Depth of the water = Ron's height * 5 = 12 feet * 5 = 60 feet

Therefore, the depth of the water is 60 feet.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is60 feet.

5 storks and 3 birds were sitting on the fence. 4 more birds came to join them. How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there are 5 storks and 3 birds sitting on the fence. So, the total number of birds and storks is 5 + 3 = 8.

Then, 4 more birds join them. Adding these 4 birds to the existing 8, we get a total of 8 + 4 = 12 birds.

To find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence, we need to subtract the number of storks from the total number of birds. In this case, we have 12 birds - 5 storks = 7 more birds than storks.

Therefore, there are 7 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is7.

Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 8 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Ed lose?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume that Doug has x marbles.
According to the problem, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 19 marbles.

After losing some marbles, Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug. So, we can set up the equation:
(x + 19) - L = x + 8

Here, L represents the number of marbles Ed lost.

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x + 19 - L = x + 8

By canceling out the x terms, we have:
19 - L = 8

To isolate L, we subtract 19 from both sides:
19 - L - 19 = 8 - 19
-L = -11

Finally, multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for L, we get:
L = 11

Therefore, Ed lost 11 marbles at the playground.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isEd lost 11 marbles.

We know that Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug, and Ed had 27 marbles. So, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 5

Substituting the given values, we have:

27 = Doug's marbles + 5

To find Doug's initial number of marbles, we need to isolate Doug's marbles on one side of the equation. Let's subtract 5 from both sides:

27 - 5 = Doug's marbles + 5 - 5

22 = Doug's marbles

Therefore, Doug initially had 22 marbles.

To solve this problem, let's first determine how many peaches and apples Jake has. 

We know that Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 18 - 8 = 10 peaches. 

Similarly, Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 11 + 10 = 21 apples. 

Now, let's compare the number of peaches and apples Steven has. 

Steven has 18 peaches and 11 apples. 

To find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has, we subtract the number of apples from the number of peaches: 

18 peaches - 11 apples = 7 more peaches than apples. 

Therefore, Steven has 7 more peaches than apples.

To find out how many minutes the machine worked in total, we need to calculate the time it took to make each batch of shirts separately and then add them together.

Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts. Since it can make 8 shirts per minute, we can divide 13 by 8 to find the number of minutes it took to make those shirts:

13 shirts / 8 shirts per minute = 1.625 minutes

So, it took approximately 1.625 minutes to make the shirts yesterday.

Today, the machine made 3 shirts. Again, dividing the number of shirts by the rate at which the machine produces them gives us the time it took:

3 shirts / 8 shirts per minute = 0.375 minutes

Therefore, it took approximately 0.375 minutes to make the shirts today.

To find the total time, we add the time from yesterday and today:

1.625 minutes + 0.375 minutes = 2 minutes

Hence, the machine worked for a total of 2 minutes to produce the 13 shirts yesterday and 3 shirts today.

To find out how many emails Jack received in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the morning and evening from the total number of emails he received in the day.

Total emails received in the day = Emails received in the morning + Emails received in the afternoon + Emails received in the evening

Given:
Total emails received in the day = 10
Emails received in the morning = 6
Emails received in the afternoon = 3

Let's substitute these values into the equation:

10 = 6 + 3 + Emails received in the evening

To find the number of emails Jack received in the evening, we can rearrange the equation:

Emails received in the evening = Total emails received in the day - Emails received in the morning - Emails received in the afternoon

Emails received in the evening = 10 - 6 - 3

After Jessie started to go jogging everyday she lost 126 kilograms. She currently weighs 66 kilograms. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?
To find out how much Jessie weighed before starting to jog, we need to subtract the weight she lost from her current weight. 

Let's denote her initial weight as 'x'. We know that she lost 126 kilograms and currently weighs 66 kilograms. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 126 = 66

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Adding 126 to both sides, we get:

x = 66 + 126
x = 192

Therefore, Jessie weighed 192 kilograms before she started jogging.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is192.

Paul had 42 pens and 143 books. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had 113 books and 19 pens left. How many pens did he sell in the garage sale?
To find out how many pens Paul sold in the garage sale, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of pens he had and the number of pens he had left after the sale.

Initial number of pens = 42
Number of pens left after the sale = 19

Pens sold = Initial number of pens - Number of pens left after the sale
Pens sold = 42 - 19
Pens sold = 23

Therefore, Paul sold 23 pens in the garage sale.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is23.

Robin's hair was 14 inches long. It grew by 8 inches. Then he cut off 20 inches. How long is his hair now?
To find out how long Robin's hair is now, let's break down the steps:

1. Robin's hair was initially 14 inches long.
2. It grew by 8 inches, so we add 8 to the initial length: 14 + 8 = 22 inches.
3. However, Robin then cut off 20 inches from his hair, so we subtract 20 from the previous length: 22 - 20 = 2 inches.

Therefore, Robin's hair is now 2 inches long.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2 inches.

Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 18 bird families living near the mountain. If 38 bird families flew away to africa and 80 bird families flew away to asia How many bird families flew away for the winter?
To find out how many bird families flew away for the winter, we need to add the number of bird families that flew to Africa and Asia. 

Given:
Number of bird families near the mountain = 18
Number of bird families that flew to Africa = 38
Number of bird families that flew to Asia = 80

To find the total number of bird families that flew away for the winter, we add the number of bird families that flew to Africa and Asia:

Total number of bird families that flew away = Number of bird families that flew to Africa + Number of bird families that flew to Asia
Total number of bird families that flew away = 38 + 80
Total number of bird families that flew away = 118

Therefore, 118 bird families flew away for the winter.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is118.

Rachel has 52 apple trees. She picked 2 apples from 1 of her trees. Now the tree has 7 apples still on it. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?
To find out how many apples the tree had to begin with, we can use the information given. 

We know that Rachel picked 2 apples from the tree, and now it has 7 apples remaining. 

So, to determine the initial number of apples on the tree, we can add the apples Rachel picked to the apples still on the tree. 

2 (apples picked) + 7 (apples remaining) = 9 apples 

Therefore, the tree initially had 9 apples.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is9.
