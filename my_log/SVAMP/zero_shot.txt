23 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 24 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 8 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?
Let's assume that x children got off the bus.
After 24 children got on the bus, the total number of children on the bus became 23 + 24 = <<23+24=47>>47.
After x children got off the bus, the total number of children on the bus became 47 - x.
Since there were 8 children altogether on the bus, then 47 - x = 8.
Therefore, x = 47 - 8 = <<47-8=39>>39.

Let's say the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is x.
The number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166.
The total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon is x + (x + 166) = 182.

28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?
Let's assume that x children got off the bus.
After 82 children got on the bus, the total number of children on the bus became 30.
So, the total number of children on the bus before 82 children got on was 30 - 82 = -52.
Since there were initially 28 children on the bus, the number of children that got off the bus is 28 - (-52) = 28 + 52 = 80.
Therefore, 82 - 80 = <<82-80=2>>2 more children got on the bus than those that got off. Answer: \boxed{2}.

If there were 21 roses in the vase and Jessica threw away 34 roses, there were 21-34 = <<21-34=-13>>-13 roses left in the vase.
After cutting some more roses from her garden, the number of roses increased to 15, meaning she cut 15-(-13) = <<15-(-13)=28>>28 roses from her garden.
The number of roses she threw away more than those she cut from her garden is 34-28 = <<34-28=6>>6. Answer: \boxed{6}.

Let's assume that Ryan spends x hours on learning Chinese.
According to the given information, Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English, which is 2 hours more than he spends on learning Chinese.
So, the total time Ryan spends on learning Chinese is x hours.
Therefore, the total time Ryan spends on learning English is x + 2 hours.
Since Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English, we can write the equation as:
x + 2 = 7
Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get:
x = 7 - 2
x = 5
Therefore, Ryan spends 5 hours on learning Chinese. Answer: \boxed{5}.

Jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 2 more action figures to the shelf and removed 7 of the old ones. If there are 10 action figures on his shelf now How many action figures did he have initially on the shelf?
Let's assume Jerry initially had x action figures on the shelf.
After adding 2 more action figures, the total number of action figures became x + 2.
After removing 7 old action figures, the total number of action figures became x + 2 - 7 = x - 5.
Given that there are 10 action figures on the shelf now, we can set up the equation x - 5 = 10.
Adding 5 to both sides of the equation, we get x = 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15.
Therefore, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf. Answer: \boxed{15}.

3 red peaches, and some more green peaches are in the basket. If there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches in the basket How many green peaches are in the basket?
Let's assume the number of red peaches in the basket is x.
Therefore, the number of green peaches in the basket is x + 10.
The total number of peaches in the basket is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10.
Since there are 3 red peaches in the basket, we can write the equation as 2x + 10 = 3.
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 3 - 10 = -7.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = -7/2 = -3.5.
Since the number of peaches cannot be negative, we conclude that there are no green peaches in the basket.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.

Let's assume the number of cookies in each bag is x.
Therefore, the total number of cookies in all the bags is 14x.
We are given that the total number of cookies and candies is 28 + 86 = 114.
So, we can write the equation as 14x = 114.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 14, we get x = 114/14 = 8.14.
Since we cannot have a fraction of a bag, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 52 crayons to his friends while he lost 535 crayons. If he only had 492 crayons left How many crayons had been lost or given away?
Let x be the number of crayons Paul had initially.
After giving away crayons to his friends, he had x - 52 crayons left.
After losing some crayons, he had x - 52 - 535 = 492 crayons left.
Combining like terms, we get x - 587 = 492.
Adding 587 to both sides, we get x = 1079.
Therefore, Paul had lost or given away 1079 - 492 = <<1079-492=587>>587 crayons. Answer: \boxed{587}.

Lawrence county has 313473 kids. During summer break 274865 kids stay home and the rest go to camp. How many kids go to the camp during the break?
To find the number of kids who go to camp during the break, we need to subtract the number of kids who stay home from the total number of kids in Lawrence county.

Number of kids going to camp = Total number of kids - Number of kids staying home
Number of kids going to camp = 313473 - 274865
Number of kids going to camp = 38608

Therefore, 38,608 kids go to camp during the break.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is38608

There were some roses in the vase. Jessica cut 16 more roses from her flower garden and put them in the vase. There are now 23 roses in the vase. How many roses were there in the vase at the beginning?
Let's assume that there were x roses in the vase at the beginning.
After Jessica cut 16 more roses, the total number of roses in the vase became x + 16.
Since there are now 23 roses in the vase, we can write the equation x + 16 = 23.
Subtracting 16 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 23 - 16 = <<23-16=7>>7.
Therefore, there were 7 roses in the vase at the beginning. Answer: \boxed{7}.

Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
Let's assume that Adam has x apples.
Jackie has x + 8 apples.
Together, they have x + (x + 8) = 2x + 8 apples.
He has 9 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so he has 2x + 8 + 9 = 2x + 17 apples.
Since we know that together they have 12 apples, we can set up the equation 2x + 17 = 12.
Subtracting 17 from both sides, we get 2x = -5.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = -2.5.
Since we can't have a negative number of apples, this means that our assumption was incorrect.
Let's try again with a different assumption.
Let's assume that Adam has y apples.
Jackie has y - 8 apples.
Together, they have y + (y - 8) = 2y - 8 apples.
He has 9 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so he has 2y - 8 + 9 = 2y + 1 apples.
Since we know that together they have 12 apples, we can set up the equation 2y + 1 = 12.
Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 2y = 11.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 5.5.
Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, this means that our assumption was incorrect.

If Lewis earns $ 1357 every week during the 223 weeks of a harvest season. How much money will he earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons?
To find out how much money Lewis will earn in 73 harvest seasons, we need to multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a harvest season and then multiply that by the number of harvest seasons.

Number of weeks in a harvest season = 223 weeks
Number of harvest seasons = 73 harvest seasons

Total earnings = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks in a harvest season * Number of harvest seasons
Total earnings = $1357 * 223 weeks * 73 harvest seasons

Calculating the total earnings:
Total earnings = $1357 * 223 * 73
Total earnings = $26,000,411

Therefore, Lewis will earn $26,000,411 if he works for 73 harvest seasons.

Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree. Thereafter 2 new apples grew on the tree. Now the tree has 6 apples still on it. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?
Let's assume the tree had x apples to begin with.
After Rachel picked 7 apples, the tree had x - 7 apples left.
Then, 2 new apples grew on the tree, so the total number of apples on the tree became x - 7 + 2 = x - 5.
Finally, we are told that the tree has 6 apples left, so we can set up the equation x - 5 = 6.
Solving this equation, we find x = 6 + 5 = <<6+5=11>>11.
Therefore, the tree had 11 apples to begin with. Answer: \boxed{11}.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is11.

The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 9 inches. The mouse jumped 3 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. How far did the mouse jump?
Let's call the distance the frog jumped x inches.
The grasshopper jumped 9 inches.
The frog jumped x inches.
The mouse jumped x - 33 inches.
The mouse jumped 9 - 3 = <<9-3=6>>6 inches less than the frog.
So, the mouse jumped x - 33 - 6 = x - 39 inches.
Since the mouse jumped x - 39 inches, then x - 39 = 0.
Therefore, the mouse jumped x = 39 inches. Answer: \boxed{39}.

He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 16 sacks per day and that each sack containes 57 oranges. How many days will it take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges?
To find out how many oranges are harvested per day, we multiply the number of sacks harvested per day (16) by the number of oranges in each sack (57): 16 sacks/day * 57 oranges/sack = <<16*57=912>>912 oranges/day.
To find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, we divide the total number of sacks (80) by the number of sacks harvested per day (16): 80 sacks / 16 sacks/day = <<80/16=5>>5 days. Answer: \boxed{5}.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is5.

At the zoo, a cage had 3 snakes and 75 alligators. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding How many alligators were not hiding?
Initially, there were 3 snakes and 75 alligators, so the total number of alligators and snakes was 3+75 = <<3+75=78>>78
If 82 snakes were hiding, the number of snakes that were not hiding is 82-3 = <<82-3=79>>79
The total number of alligators and snakes that were hiding is 79+19 = <<79+19=98>>98
The number of alligators that were not hiding is 78-98 = <<78-98=-20>>-20.
Since the number of alligators cannot be negative, it means that there were no alligators that were not hiding. Answer: \boxed{0}.

Let's assume Paul got x crayons for his birthday.
By the end of the school year, he had lost or given away 551 crayons, so he had x - 551 crayons left.
We are told that he only had 177 crayons left, so we can write the equation x - 551 = 177.
Adding 551 to both sides of the equation, we get x = 177 + 551 = 728.
Therefore, Paul got 728 crayons for his birthday. Answer: \boxed{728}.

After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 92 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace before that day?
To find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace before the day Rachel visited, we need to add up the number of visitors from the previous days.

The total number of visitors from the previous day is 419.
The total number of visitors from the day before that is 103.
The total number of visitors from the day Rachel visited is 92.

To find the total number of visitors before that day, we need to subtract the visitors from the previous two days from the total number of visitors.

Total number of visitors before that day = Total number of visitors - Visitors from the previous day - Visitors from the day before that
Total number of visitors before that day = 419 - 103 - 92
Total number of visitors before that day = 224

Therefore, 224 visitors visited the Buckingham palace before the day Rachel visited.

Bobby ate some pieces of candy. Then he ate 25 more. If he ate a total of 43 pieces of candy How many pieces of candy had he eaten at the start?
Let's say Bobby had eaten x pieces of candy at the start.
After eating 25 more pieces, he had eaten x + 25 pieces of candy.
The total number of pieces of candy he ate is x + (x + 25) = 43.
Combining like terms, we get 2x + 25 = 43.
Subtracting 25 from both sides, we get 2x = 18.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 9.
Therefore, Bobby had eaten 9 pieces of candy at the start. Answer: \boxed{9}.

Julia played tag with 16 kids on monday. If she played tag with 12 more kids on monday than on tuesday How many kids did she play with on tuesday?
Let's assume that Julia played with x kids on Tuesday.
According to the given information, Julia played with 12 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday, so she played with x + 12 kids on Monday.
We also know that Julia played with 16 kids on Monday.
Therefore, we can write the equation x + 12 = 16.
Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 16 - 12 = 4.
So, Julia played with 4 kids on Tuesday. Answer: \boxed{4}.

Let's assume the number of boys in the school is x.
According to the given information, the number of girls is 739.
We are also given that there are 402 more girls than boys.
So, the number of girls is x + 402.
Since we know that the number of girls is 739, we can set up the equation:
x + 402 = 739
Subtracting 402 from both sides of the equation, we get:

22 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 40 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 2 children altogether on the bus. How many children got off the bus at the bus stop?
Let's assume that x children got off the bus at the bus stop.
Initially, there were 22 children on the bus.
After 40 children got on the bus, the total number of children on the bus became 22 + 40 = <<22+40=62>>62.
After some children got off the bus, there were 2 children left on the bus.
Therefore, 62 - x = 2.
Simplifying the equation, we get 62 = 2 + x.
Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get 62 - 2 = x.
Thus, x = 60.
Therefore, 60 children got off the bus at the bus stop. Answer: \boxed{60}.

In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys How many boys are there in that school?
Let's assume the number of boys in the school is x.
According to the given information, the number of girls is 697.
We are also given that there are 228 more girls than boys.
So, the number of girls can be expressed as x + 228.
Since the total number of students in the school is the sum of the number of girls and boys, we can write the equation:
x + (x + 228) = 697
Combining like terms, we get:
2x + 228 = 697
Subtracting 228 from both sides, we get:
2x = 469
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 234.5
Since the number of boys cannot be a decimal, we round down to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, there are 234 boys in that school. Answer: \boxed{234}.

Let's assume that the number of visitors on the previous day is x.
The total number of visitors in the past 327 days is 406.
So, the total number of visitors in the past 327 days, including the previous day, is x + 406.
The total number of visitors on the previous day and that day is 132 + x.
Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 406 = 132 + x.
By subtracting x from both sides of the equation, we get 406 = 132.
This equation is not possible, which means there is no solution.
Therefore, we cannot determine the number of visitors on the previous day with the given information.

Let's assume that Ryan spends x hours on learning Chinese.
According to the given information, he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese, so he spends x + 2 hours on learning English.
Therefore, the total time he spends on learning both languages is x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2 hours.
Since he spends 5 hours on learning Chinese, we can set up the equation 2x + 2 = 5.

The cave is 1218 feet deep and they are already at 849 feet. If they are travelling at speed of 17 How much farther until they reach the end of the cave?
To find out how much farther they need to travel until they reach the end of the cave, we need to subtract the depth they have already covered from the total depth of the cave.

Total depth of the cave = 1218 feet
Depth covered = 849 feet

Therefore, the distance they need to travel further is:
1218 feet - 849 feet = 369 feet

Since they are traveling at a speed of 17 feet, it will take them:
369 feet / 17 feet = 21.7 (approximately) seconds to reach the end of the cave.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is369 feet.

The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?
Let's assume the distance the frog jumped is x inches.
The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper jumped x + 4 inches.
The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse jumped x - 44 inches.
The total distance covered by all three is x + (x + 4) + (x - 44) = 3x - 40 inches.
Given that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, we have 3x - 40 = 19.
Adding 40 to both sides, we get 3x = 59.
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 59/3 = <<59/3=19.666666666666668>>19.67 inches.
Therefore, the frog jumped approximately 19.67 inches. Answer: \boxed{19.67}.
