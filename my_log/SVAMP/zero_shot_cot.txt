Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She already put in 10 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
Let's think step by step.
First, let's find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar and she already put in 10 cups, so she needs to add 12 - 10 = <<12-10=2>>2 more cups of sugar.

Next, let's find out how many cups of flour Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and she hasn't added any yet, so she needs to add 14 - 0 = <<14-0=14>>14 cups of flour.

Finally, let's find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add. She needs to add 14 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar, so she needs to add 14 - 2 = <<14-2=12>>12 more cups of flour than cups of sugar. Answer: \boxed{12}.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the 15 bottle caps at the park. We know that he found 15 bottle caps at the park and now has 35 bottle caps in his collection, so he had 35 - 15 = <<35-15=20>>20 bottle caps before he found the ones at the park.
Next, we need to find out how many wrappers Danny had before he found the 18 wrappers at the park. We know that he found 18 wrappers at the park and now has 67 wrappers in his collection, so he had 67 - 18 = <<67-18=49>>49 wrappers before he found the ones at the park.
Finally, we need to find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now. We know that he has 67 wrappers and 35 bottle caps, so he has 67 - 35 = <<67-35=32>>32 more wrappers than bottle caps. Answer: \boxed{32}.

Let's think step by step.
First, let's find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. To do this, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already put in from the total amount of flour called for in the recipe. 

Total amount of flour called for in the recipe: 12 cups
Amount of flour Mary has already put in: 2 cups

12 cups - 2 cups = 10 cups

Mary needs to add 10 more cups of flour.

Next, let's find out how many cups of salt Mary needs to add. 

Total amount of salt called for in the recipe: 7 cups

Mary needs to add 7 cups of salt.

Finally, let's find out the difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of salt that Mary needs to add. 

Difference = Number of cups of flour - Number of cups of salt
Difference = 10 cups - 7 cups
Difference = 3 cups

Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of salt.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 78 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 186 t-shirts. If they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the Texas tech game?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game.
Total number of t-shirts sold = Total number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game + Total number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game
Total number of t-shirts sold = 172 + x (where x is the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game)

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the total number of t-shirts sold.
Total number of t-shirts sold = 186

Step 3: Substitute the value of the total number of t-shirts sold from step 1 into the equation from step 2.
172 + x = 186

Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
x = 186 - 172
x = 14

Step 5: Calculate the money made from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.
Money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game = Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game * Money made per t-shirt
Money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game = 14 * $78
Money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game = $1092

Therefore, they made $1092 from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

The ring toss game at the carnival made the same amount of money each day. In total in 30 days they earned 420 dollars. Together with game they earned 22 dollars. How much did ring toss game make per day?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume that the amount of money the ring toss game made each day is x dollars.

Step 2: We know that the ring toss game made the same amount of money each day for 30 days, so the total amount of money made by the ring toss game is 30x dollars.

Step 3: We also know that together with the other game, they earned 22 dollars. So, the total amount of money made by both games is 30x + 22 dollars.

Step 4: We are given that the total amount of money made by both games is 420 dollars. So, we can set up the equation 30x + 22 = 420.

Step 5: Now, we can solve the equation for x. Subtracting 22 from both sides of the equation, we get 30x = 398.

Step 6: Dividing both sides of the equation by 30, we get x = 13.27.

Therefore, the ring toss game made approximately 13.27 dollars per day.

Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon How many students suggested bacon?
Let's think step by step.
Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x.
Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is x + 63.
The total number of students who suggested specific types of food is x + (x + 63) = 457.
Combining like terms, we get 2x + 63 = 457.
Subtracting 63 from both sides, we get 2x = 394.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 197.
Therefore, 197 students suggested adding bacon to the menu. Answer: \boxed{197}.

Carol was sending out birthday invitations to her friends. Each package of invitations she bought had 10 invitations in it and she bought 7 packs. If she sends invitations to only 2 friends How many invitations will be left?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of invitations Carol bought.
Since each pack of invitations has 10 invitations, and Carol bought 7 packs, the total number of invitations she bought is 10 x 7 = <<10*7=70>>70 invitations.

Step 2: Calculate the number of invitations Carol will send.
Carol will send invitations to only 2 friends, so the number of invitations she will send is 2 x 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 invitations.

Step 3: Calculate the number of invitations that will be left.
To find the number of invitations that will be left, subtract the number of invitations Carol will send from the total number of invitations she bought: 70 - 2 = <<70-2=68>>68 invitations.

The Razorback shop makes $ 210 dollars off each jersey and $ 240 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys.
Revenue from selling jerseys = Number of jerseys sold * Revenue per jersey
Revenue from selling jerseys = 23 * $210 = $<<23*210=4830>>4830

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts.
Revenue from selling t-shirts = Number of t-shirts sold * Revenue per t-shirt
Revenue from selling t-shirts = 177 * $240 = $<<177*240=42480>>42480

Step 3: Calculate the difference in revenue between t-shirts and jerseys.
Difference in revenue = Revenue from selling t-shirts - Revenue from selling jerseys
Difference in revenue = $42480 - $4830 = $<<42480-4830=37650>>37650

Step 4: Calculate the difference in cost between a t-shirt and a jersey.
Difference in cost = Difference in revenue / Number of t-shirts sold
Difference in cost = $37650 / 177 = $<<37650/177=212.71>>212.71

Therefore, a t-shirt costs $212.71 more than a jersey.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is212.71

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of crayons and erasers Paul had at the beginning.
The total number of crayons and erasers Paul had at the beginning is 521 crayons + 66 erasers = <<521+66=587>>587 items.

Step 2: Calculate the number of items Paul had left at the end of the school year.
Paul had 154 items left at the end of the school year.

Step 3: Calculate the number of crayons Paul had left at the end of the school year.
Paul had 154 items left at the end of the school year, and he didn't lose any erasers, so the number of crayons he had left is 154 items - 66 erasers = <<154-66=88>>88 crayons.

Step 4: Calculate the number of crayons that were lost or given away.
The number of crayons that were lost or given away is the difference between the total number of crayons Paul had at the beginning and the number of crayons he had left at the end of the school year, which is 521 crayons - 88 crayons = <<521-88=433>>433 crayons. Answer: \boxed{433}.

Let's think step by step.
To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace in the past 89 days, we need to add up the number of visitors for each day.

First, let's find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace in the past 3 days: 512 + 471 + 808 = 1791 visitors.

Now, let's find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace in the past 89 days by multiplying the number of visitors in the past 3 days by the number of sets of 3 days in 89 days: 1791 visitors * (89 days / 3 days) = 1791 visitors * 29.6667 sets of 3 days.

Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we need to round down to the nearest whole number: 1791 visitors * 29 = 51,939 visitors.

Therefore, 51,939 visitors visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days.

Let's think step by step.
Let's assume the number of pages of reading homework Rachel had to complete is x.

According to the given information, Rachel had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework. So, the number of pages of math homework Rachel had to complete is x + 4.

The total number of pages of homework Rachel had to complete is the sum of the pages of math and reading homework, which is 7.

Therefore, the equation representing the given information is x + (x + 4) = 7.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 4 = 7.

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 3.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 3/2.

Since we cannot have half a page of homework, we can conclude that Rachel had to complete 1 page of reading homework.

Let's think step by step.
Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is x.
According to the information given, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166.
The total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon is x + (x + 166) = 182.

White t - shirts can be purchased in packages of 53. If mom buys 57 packages of white t - shirts and 34 trousers How many white t - shirts will she have?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of white t-shirts in one package.
Since one package contains 53 white t-shirts, there are 53 white t-shirts in one package.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of white t-shirts in 57 packages.
To find the total number of white t-shirts in 57 packages, multiply the number of packages (57) by the number of white t-shirts in one package (53).
57 packages * 53 white t-shirts per package = 3012 white t-shirts.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of white t-shirts.
Since mom also bought 34 trousers, the total number of white t-shirts she will have is the sum of the white t-shirts in the packages and the white t-shirts bought separately.
Total white t-shirts = 3012 white t-shirts (from the packages) + 0 white t-shirts (bought separately) = 3012 white t-shirts.

Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 8 bird families living near the mountain. If 42 bird families flew away to africa and 31 bird families flew away to asia How many more bird families flew away to africa than those that flew away to asia?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the total number of bird families that flew away. We can do this by adding the number of bird families that flew to Africa and the number of bird families that flew to Asia: 42 + 31 = <<42+31=73>>73 bird families.

Next, we need to find the difference between the number of bird families that flew to Africa and the number that flew to Asia. We can do this by subtracting the number of bird families that flew to Asia from the number that flew to Africa: 42 - 31 = <<42-31=11>>11 bird families.

Therefore, 11 more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is11.

Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cakes. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 11 friends How many crackers did each person eat?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Find the total number of crackers and cakes Matthew had.
Total number of crackers and cakes = 22 crackers + 34 cakes = 56

Step 2: Divide the total number of crackers and cakes by the number of friends.
Number of crackers and cakes per friend = 56 / 11 = 5.09

Step 3: Since we can't have a fraction of a cracker, we round down to the nearest whole number.
Number of crackers per friend = 5

Therefore, each person ate 5 crackers.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is5.

Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds. If together their strawberries weighed 47 pounds. How much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries.
Since together their strawberries weighed 47 pounds and Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds, we can subtract Marco's strawberries' weight from the total weight to find his dad's strawberries' weight.
47 pounds - 30 pounds = 17 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the difference in weight between Marco's strawberries and his dad's strawberries.
To find the difference in weight, we subtract Marco's dad's strawberries' weight from Marco's strawberries' weight.
30 pounds - 17 pounds = 13 pounds

Step 3: Answer the question.
Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds more than his dad's strawberries.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 11 cups of sugar. She already put in 4 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?
Let's think step by step.
First, let's find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and she already put in 4 cups, so she needs to add 9 - 4 = <<9-4=5>>5 more cups of flour.

Next, let's find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and she hasn't added any yet, so she needs to add 11 - 0 = <<11-0=11>>11 more cups of sugar.

Finally, let's find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour Mary needs to add. She needs to add 11 cups of sugar and 5 cups of flour, so she needs to add 11 - 5 = <<11-5=6>>6 more cups of sugar than cups of flour. Answer: \boxed{6}.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar 6 cups of flour and 9 cups of salt. She already put in 12 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?
Let's think step by step.
First, let's find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and she already put in 12 cups, so she needs to add 6 - 12 = -6 cups of flour.
Since she already put in more flour than the recipe calls for, she doesn't need to add any more flour.
Now let's find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and she hasn't put in any yet, so she needs to add 11 - 0 = 11 cups of sugar.
Finally, let's find out how many more cups of salt Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 9 cups of salt and she hasn't put in any yet, so she needs to add 9 - 0 = 9 cups of salt.
Therefore, Mary needs to add 11 - 9 = <<11-9=2>>2 more cups of sugar than cups of salt. Answer: \boxed{2}.

To find the total revenue from selling t-shirts, we need to multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the profit made from each t-shirt. 

Number of t-shirts sold = 20
Profit made from each t-shirt = $215

Total revenue from selling t-shirts = Number of t-shirts sold * Profit made from each t-shirt
Total revenue from selling t-shirts = 20 * $215 = $<<20*215=4300>>4300

Therefore, the Razorback shop made $4300 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.

Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 58 bottle caps and 25 wrappers at the park. Now he has 11 wrappers and 12 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers does danny have now?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the ones at the park. To do this, we subtract the number of bottle caps he found at the park (58) from the number he has now (12): 12 - 58 = -46.

Next, we need to find out how many wrappers Danny had before he found the ones at the park. To do this, we subtract the number of wrappers he found at the park (25) from the number he has now (11): 11 - 25 = -14.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of bottle caps and the number of wrappers Danny has now. To do this, we subtract the number of wrappers (-14) from the number of bottle caps (-46): -46 - (-14) = -46 + 14 = -32.

Since Danny has a negative number of bottle caps and wrappers, it means he has more wrappers than bottle caps. Therefore, Danny has 32 more wrappers than bottle caps.

Let's think step by step.
1. Nell starts with 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards.
2. She gives some cards to Jeff, so she now has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left.
3. To find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff, we subtract the current number of cards from the original number of cards.
   - Nell had 438 baseball cards and now has 178 left, so she gave away 438 - 178 = 260 baseball cards.
   - Nell had 18 Ace cards and now has 55 left, so she gave away 18 - 55 = -37 Ace cards.
4. Since we can't have a negative number of cards, we assume that Nell gave away 0 Ace cards.
5. Now we can calculate how many more baseball cards Nell has than Ace cards.
   - Nell has 178 baseball cards and 55 Ace cards, so she has 178 - 55 = 123 more baseball cards than Ace cards. Answer: \boxed{123}.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys.
The Razorback shop sold 78 jerseys, and each jersey makes $115 in revenue. Therefore, the total revenue from selling jerseys is 78 * $115 = $<<78*115=8970>>8970.

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts.
The Razorback shop sold 113 t-shirts, and each t-shirt makes $25 in revenue. Therefore, the total revenue from selling t-shirts is 113 * $25 = $<<113*25=2825>>2825.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in revenue between jerseys and t-shirts.
The revenue from selling jerseys is $8970, and the revenue from selling t-shirts is $2825. Therefore, the difference in revenue between jerseys and t-shirts is $8970 - $2825 = $<<8970-2825=6145>>6145.

Every day Ryan spends 7 hours on learning english and some more hours on learning chinese. If he spends 2 hours more on learning english than on learning chinese How many hours does he spend on learning chinese?
Let's think step by step.
Let's assume that Ryan spends x hours on learning Chinese.

According to the given information, Ryan spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends x + 2 hours on learning English.

In total, Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English and some more hours on learning Chinese. So, the total time spent on learning English and Chinese is 7 + x + 2 = 9 + x.

Since the total time spent on learning English and Chinese is the sum of the time spent on each language, we can write the equation as follows:

9 + x = total time spent on learning Chinese and English.

Since we are looking for the time spent on learning Chinese, we need to isolate x in the equation.

Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = total time spent on learning Chinese and English - 9.

Therefore, Ryan spends x hours on learning Chinese.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pastries and cakes that Baker made.
Total pastries = 52
Total cakes = 84

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pastries and cakes that Baker sold.
Total pastries sold = 94
Total cakes sold = 102

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total number of cakes and pastries made and the total number of cakes and pastries sold.
Difference in pastries = Total pastries - Total pastries sold = 52 - 94 = -42
Difference in cakes = Total cakes - Total cakes sold = 84 - 102 = -18

Step 4: Calculate the absolute value of the differences to find the number of more cakes than pastries.
Absolute value of difference in pastries = |-42| = 42
Absolute value of difference in cakes = |-18| = 18

Therefore, Baker made 18 more cakes than pastries.

Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 49 bird families living near the mountain. 59 bird families flew away for winter and 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. How many bird families were left near the mountain?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the total number of bird families near the mountain before any migration or new arrivals. We are told that there are 49 bird families living near the mountain.

Next, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away for winter. We are told that 59 bird families flew away for winter. 

49 - 59 = -10

However, we cannot have a negative number of bird families, so we know that there must be an error in our calculations.

Upon reviewing the problem, we realize that we made a mistake in subtracting the number of bird families that flew away. We should have subtracted this number from the total number of bird families near the mountain, not from zero.

So, let's correct our calculation:

49 - 59 = -10

To fix this, we need to add the number of bird families that flew away to the total number of bird families near the mountain.

49 + 59 = 108

Now, we need to add the number of new bird families that came to live near the mountain from the arctic. We are told that 24 new bird families arrived.

108 + 24 = 132

Therefore, there were 132 bird families left near the mountain after the migration and new arrivals.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is132.

In Haley's class 13 boys love to play marbles and 50 boys love to play cards. If Haley has 26 marbles How many will each of the boys receive?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the total number of boys in Haley's class who love to play marbles and cards. To do this, we add the number of boys who love to play marbles (13) and the number of boys who love to play cards (50): 13 + 50 = 63 boys.

Next, we need to divide the total number of marbles (26) by the total number of boys (63) to find out how many marbles each boy will receive: 26 / 63 = 0.41 marbles.

Since we can't have a fraction of a marble, each boy will receive 0 marbles.

Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses and orchids in the vase.
Initial number of roses = 9
Initial number of orchids = 6

Step 2: Calculate the total number of flowers in the vase initially.
Total number of flowers initially = Initial number of roses + Initial number of orchids
Total number of flowers initially = 9 + 6 = 15

Step 3: Calculate the number of roses and orchids Jessica cut from her flower garden.
Number of roses Jessica cut = Initial number of roses - Number of roses in the vase now
Number of roses Jessica cut = 9 - 3 = 6
Number of orchids Jessica cut = Initial number of orchids - Number of orchids in the vase now
Number of orchids Jessica cut = 6 - 13 = -7

Step 4: Calculate the total number of flowers Jessica cut from her flower garden.
Total number of flowers Jessica cut = Number of roses Jessica cut + Number of orchids Jessica cut
Total number of flowers Jessica cut = 6 + (-7) = -1

Step 5: Calculate the number of orchids than roses in the vase now.
Number of orchids than roses in the vase now = Number of orchids in the vase now - Number of roses in the vase now
Number of orchids than roses in the vase now = 13 - 3 = 10

The Ferris wheel has 18 seats, and each seat can hold 15 people, so the total number of people the Ferris wheel can hold is 18 seats * 15 people/seat = <<18*15=270>>270 people.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people that can't ride the Ferris wheel due to the broken seats.
If 10 seats are broken, then the number of people that can't ride the Ferris wheel is 10 seats * 15 people/seat = <<10*15=150>>150 people.

Step 3: Calculate the number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time.
The total number of people the Ferris wheel can hold is 270 people, and the number of people that can't ride due to broken seats is 150 people, so the number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time is 270 people - 150 people = <<270-150=120>>120 people. Answer: \boxed{120}.

And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today.
Yesterday: 519 chocolate chip cookies
Today: 359 chocolate chip cookies
Total chocolate chip cookies = 519 + 359 = 878 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the total number of raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today.
Yesterday: 300 raisin cookies
Today: 280 raisin cookies
Total raisin cookies = 300 + 280 = 580 cookies

Step 3: Calculate the difference in the number of raisin cookies baked yesterday compared to today.
Difference = Number of raisin cookies baked yesterday - Number of raisin cookies baked today
Difference = 580 - 280 = 300

Therefore, Helen baked 300 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.

David did 51 push-ups in gym class today. David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary. How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many push-ups Zachary did. We know that David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can subtract 49 from the total number of push-ups David did: 51 push-ups - 49 push-ups = <<51-49=2>>2 push-ups.

Now we can add the number of push-ups David did to the number of push-ups Zachary did to find the total number of push-ups: 2 push-ups + 51 push-ups = <<2+51=53>>53 push-ups. Answer: \boxed{53}.

The Razorback shop makes $ 76 dollars off each jersey and $ 204 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 158 t-shirts and 2 jerseys. How much money did they make from selling the jerseys?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys.
Revenue from selling jerseys = Number of jerseys sold * Revenue per jersey
Revenue from selling jerseys = 2 * $76 = $<<2*76=152>>152

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts.
Revenue from selling t-shirts = Number of t-shirts sold * Revenue per t-shirt
Revenue from selling t-shirts = 158 * $204 = $<<158*204=32712>>32,712

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling both jerseys and t-shirts.
Total revenue = Revenue from selling jerseys + Revenue from selling t-shirts
Total revenue = $152 + $32,712 = $<<152+32712=32864>>32,864

Therefore, the Razorback shop made $152 from selling the jerseys.

Let's think step by step.
Let's assume Jerry initially had x action figures on the shelf.
After adding 2 more action figures, the total number of action figures becomes x + 2.
After removing 7 old action figures, the total number of action figures becomes (x + 2) - 7.
According to the given information, the final number of action figures is 10.
So, we can write the equation as (x + 2) - 7 = 10.
Simplifying the equation, we get x - 5 = 10.
Adding 5 to both sides of the equation, we get x = 15.
Therefore, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf.

Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines after 57 stops. He was told by 252 of the pickers that they fill 108 drums of grapes per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the number of drums filled per day by one picker.
Since 252 pickers fill 108 drums per day, one picker fills 108/252 = <<108/252=0.42857142857142855>>0.43 drums per day.

Step 2: Calculate the number of drums filled in 58 days by one picker.
In 58 days, one picker would fill 0.43 x 58 = <<0.43*58=24.94>>24.94 drums.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of drums filled in 58 days by all the pickers.
Since there is only one picker, the total number of drums filled in 58 days would also be 24.94 drums.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is24.94 drums.

Edward spent $ 6 to buy 2 books each book costing him the same amount of money. Now he has $ 12. How much did each book cost?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: We know that Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books. Let's assume the cost of each book is x dollars.

Step 2: Since Edward bought 2 books, the total cost of the books is 2x dollars.

Step 3: We also know that Edward now has $12. So, we can write the equation: 2x = $12.

Step 4: To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = $12 / 2.

Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we find that x = $6.

Therefore, each book costs $6.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
Let's think step by step.
First, let's find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. To do this, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already put in from the total amount of flour needed. 

Total amount of flour needed = 9 cups
Amount of flour already put in = 2 cups

So, Mary needs to add 9 - 2 = <<9-2=7>>7 more cups of flour.

Next, let's find out how many cups of sugar Mary needs to add. 

Total amount of sugar needed = 6 cups

So, Mary needs to add 6 cups of sugar.

Finally, let's find out the difference between the amount of flour and the amount of sugar Mary needs to add. 

Difference = Amount of flour needed - Amount of sugar needed
Difference = 7 cups - 6 cups
Difference = 1 cup

Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour than cups of sugar.

David did 27 more push-ups but 7 less crunches than Zachary in gym class today. If Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. We know that David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 27 to the number of push-ups Zachary did: 5 push-ups + 27 push-ups = <<5+27=32>>32 push-ups
Next, we need to find out how many crunches David did. We know that David did 7 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 7 from the number of crunches Zachary did: 17 crunches - 7 crunches = <<17-7=10>>10 crunches
Finally, we need to find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did. We can subtract the number of push-ups Zachary did from the number of crunches Zachary did: 17 crunches - 5 push-ups = <<17-5=12>>12 more crunches. Answer: \boxed{12}.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is12.

Jesse's room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide. If each tile is of size 4 square feet How many tiles does she need to cover the whole floor?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate the area of Jesse's room. To do this, we multiply the length by the width: 2 feet * 12 feet = 24 square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many tiles are needed to cover the entire floor. Since each tile is 4 square feet, we divide the total area of the room by the area of each tile: 24 square feet / 4 square feet = 6 tiles.

Therefore, Jesse needs 6 tiles to cover the whole floor.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

Let's think step by step.
Let's assume Doug had x marbles initially.
According to the first statement, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 2 marbles.
According to the second statement, Ed now has 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has x + 2 + 19 = x + 21 marbles.
Since Ed and Doug have the same number of marbles, we can set up the equation x + 21 = x.
Simplifying the equation, we get 21 = 0, which is not possible.
Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.

Faye was placing her pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row. She had 6 packs of pencils each one having 14 pencils. How many pencils does she have?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many pencils Faye has in total in each pack. To do this, we multiply the number of pencils in each pack by the number of packs: 14 pencils/pack * 6 packs = <<14*6=84>>84 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many rows Faye can make with the pencils she has. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row: 84 pencils / 22 pencils/row = <<84/22=3.8181818181818183>>3.82 rows.

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we round down to the nearest whole number: 3 rows.

Finally, we multiply the number of rows by the number of pencils in each row to find the total number of pencils Faye has: 3 rows * 22 pencils/row = <<3*22=66>>66 pencils. Answer: \boxed{66}.

Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 52 crayons to his friends while he lost 535 crayons. If he only had 492 crayons left How many crayons had been lost or given away?
Let's think step by step.
To find out how many crayons Paul had originally, we need to add the number of crayons he gave away and the number of crayons he lost to the number of crayons he had left.

Let's represent the number of crayons Paul had originally as "x".

We know that Paul gave away 52 crayons and lost 535 crayons.

So, the equation becomes: x - 52 - 535 = 492

Simplifying the equation, we get: x - 587 = 492

To isolate "x", we add 587 to both sides of the equation: x = 492 + 587

Adding the numbers, we find that x = 1079.

Therefore, Paul originally had 1079 crayons.

To find out how many crayons had been lost or given away, we subtract the number of crayons Paul had left from the number of crayons he originally had.

So, 1079 - 492 = 587 crayons had been lost or given away.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is587.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff.
Nell started with 246 baseball cards and now has 404, so she gave away 246 - 404 = <<246-404=158>>158 baseball cards.
Nell started with 214 Ace cards and now has 495, so she gave away 214 - 495 = <<214-495=-281>>-281 Ace cards.
Since Nell can't give away negative cards, we know that she gave away 0 Ace cards.

Step 2: Calculate how many cards Nell has in total.
Nell has 404 baseball cards + 495 Ace cards = <<404+495=899>>899 cards in total.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the number of Ace cards and baseball cards.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Find the total number of students in the school.
Since there are 24 classrooms and each classroom has the same number of students, we can find the total number of students by multiplying the number of classrooms by the number of students in each classroom.
Total number of students = 24 classrooms * x students/classroom, where x is the number of students in each class.

Step 2: Set up an equation to solve for x.
We know that the total number of students in the school is 120, so we can set up the equation:
120 = 24x

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
Divide both sides of the equation by 24:
120/24 = x
5 = x

Step 4: Interpret the solution.
The solution to the equation is x = 5. This means that there are 5 students in each classroom.

First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. We know that David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 38 to Zachary's number of push-ups: 46 + 38 = <<46+38=84>>84 push-ups.
Next, we need to find out how many crunches David did. We know that David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 62 from Zachary's number of crunches: 58 - 62 = <<58-62=-4>>-4 crunches.
Since we can't have a negative number of crunches, we can assume that David did 0 crunches.
Finally, we can find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did by subtracting the number of push-ups from the number of crunches: 58 - 46 = <<58-46=12>>12 more crunches. Answer: \boxed{12}.

Lewis earns $ 403 every week during the 233 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 49 rent every week How much money does he earn during harvest season?
Let's think step by step.
To find out how much money Lewis earns during the harvest season, we need to multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the harvest season.

Lewis earns $403 every week during the 233 weeks of harvest.

So, his total earnings during the harvest season is $403 x 233 = $<<403*233=93999>>93,999.

However, Lewis also has to pay $49 rent every week.

So, his total expenses for rent during the harvest season is $49 x 233 = $<<49*233=11417>>11,417.

To find out how much money Lewis earns during the harvest season, we subtract his total expenses from his total earnings.

Lewis earns $93,999 - $11,417 = $<<93999-11417=82582>>82,582 during the harvest season. Answer: \boxed{82582}.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$82,582.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 5 cups of flour and 14 cups of sugar. She already put in 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add?
Let's think step by step.
First, let's find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. To do this, we subtract the amount of flour she has already put in (10 cups) from the total amount of flour needed (5 cups). 

5 cups - 10 cups = -5 cups

Since the result is negative, it means that Mary has already put in more flour than the recipe calls for. Therefore, she does not need to add any more cups of flour.

Now, let's find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add. To do this, we subtract the amount of sugar she has already put in (2 cups) from the total amount of sugar needed (14 cups).

14 cups - 2 cups = 12 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 12 more cups of sugar.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is12.

Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them. He needs a total of 57 g of colors to paint them. He needs 22 g of wax more. If the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax How many grams of wax does he already have?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total amount of wax needed for the feathers and colors.
Total wax needed = wax for feathers + wax for colors
Total wax needed = 353 g + 22 g
Total wax needed = 375 g

Step 2: Calculate the amount of wax he already has.
Amount of wax he already has = Total wax needed - wax for feathers
Amount of wax he already has = 375 g - 353 g
Amount of wax he already has = 22 g

Therefore, he already has 22 grams of wax.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is22.

There were some roses in the vase. Jessica cut 16 more roses from her flower garden and put them in the vase. There are now 23 roses in the vase. How many roses were there in the vase at the beginning?
Let's think step by step.
Let's assume that there were x roses in the vase at the beginning.
Jessica cut 16 more roses from her flower garden and put them in the vase, so the total number of roses in the vase became x + 16.
According to the problem, there are now 23 roses in the vase, so we can write the equation x + 16 = 23.
To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 16 from both sides of the equation: x + 16 - 16 = 23 - 16.
This simplifies to x = 7.
Therefore, there were 7 roses in the vase at the beginning.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is7.

Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches in gym class today. David did 58 more push-ups but 87 less crunches than zachary. How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. We know that David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 58 to the number of push-ups Zachary did: 35 push-ups + 58 push-ups = <<35+58=93>>93 push-ups
Next, we need to find out how many crunches David did. We know that David did 87 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 87 from the number of crunches Zachary did: 3 crunches - 87 crunches = <<3-87=-84>>-84 crunches
Since you can't have negative crunches, we know that David did 0 crunches.
Finally, we need to find out how many more push-ups than crunches Zachary did. We can subtract the number of crunches Zachary did from the number of push-ups Zachary did: 35 push-ups - 3 crunches = <<35-3=32>>32 more push-ups than crunches. Answer: \boxed{32}.

Let's think step by step.
Let's assume that Adam has x apples.
Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, Jackie has x - 8 apples.
Together, Adam and Jackie have x + (x - 8) = 2x - 8 apples.
We are given that He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do, so He has (2x - 8) + 9 = 2x + 1 apples.
We are also given that together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples, so 2x - 8 = 12.
Adding 8 to both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 20.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 10.
Therefore, He has 2x + 1 = 2(10) + 1 = 21 apples. Answer: \boxed{21}.

There were 15 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 17 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she cut than those she threw away?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase.
Step 2: After throwing away 33 roses, there were 15 - 33 = -18 roses in the vase.
Step 3: Jessica cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.
Step 4: After cutting some more roses, there are now 17 roses in the vase.
Step 5: To find out how many more roses Jessica cut than those she threw away, we need to find the difference between the number of roses she cut and the number of roses she threw away.
Step 6: The number of roses she cut is 17 - (-18) = 17 + 18 = 35.
Step 7: The number of roses she threw away is 33.
Step 8: Therefore, Jessica cut 35 - 33 = <<35-33=2>>2 more roses than those she threw away. Answer: \boxed{2}.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

Jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover her room. If her room is 2 feet wide What is the length of her room?
Let's think step by step.
To find the length of Jesse's room, we need to divide the total area of the room by its width. 

The total area of the room is given as 10 square feet. 

The width of the room is given as 2 feet. 

To find the length, we divide the total area by the width:

There are 203 bananas and 63 oranges in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 7 groups and oranges are organized into 95 groups How big is each group of bananas?
Let's think step by step.
To find the size of each group of bananas, we need to divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups they are organized into.

Total number of bananas = 203
Number of groups = 7

Size of each group of bananas = Total number of bananas / Number of groups
Size of each group of bananas = 203 / 7
Size of each group of bananas = 29

Therefore, each group of bananas has 29 bananas.

Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond but stray cats loved eating them. Now she has 2 left. How many goldfish disappeared?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Find the total number of fish Paige had initially.
Total number of fish = number of goldfish + number of catfish
Total number of fish = 16 goldfish + 71 catfish
Total number of fish = 87 fish

Step 2: Find the number of fish that disappeared.
Number of fish that disappeared = Total number of fish - Number of fish left
Number of fish that disappeared = 87 fish - 2 fish
Number of fish that disappeared = 85 fish

Step 3: Determine how many of the disappeared fish were goldfish.
Number of goldfish disappeared = Total number of fish disappeared - Number of catfish disappeared
Number of goldfish disappeared = 85 fish - 0 catfish
Number of goldfish disappeared = 85 fish

Therefore, 85 goldfish disappeared.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game.
Revenue from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game = Number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game * Revenue per t-shirt
Revenue from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game = 115 * $106 = $<<115*106=12190>>12,190

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts during both games.
Total revenue from selling t-shirts during both games = Total number of t-shirts sold * Revenue per t-shirt
Total revenue from selling t-shirts during both games = $12,190

Step 3: Calculate the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game.
Total revenue from selling t-shirts during both games = Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game * Revenue per t-shirt
$12,190 = Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game * $106

Divide both sides of the equation by $106:
Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = $12,190 / $106
Number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = 115

Therefore, they sold 115 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Find the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days.
To find the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days, we need to add up the number of visitors each day. We know that there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. So, the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days is 191 + 457 = 648.

Step 2: Find the difference in the number of visitors between that day and the previous 245 days.
To find the difference in the number of visitors between that day and the previous 245 days, we subtract the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days from the number of visitors on that day. We know that there were 705 visitors on that day. So, the difference is 705 - 648 = 57.

Therefore, there were 57 more visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is57.

The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's start by finding out how far the frog jumped. We know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, so the frog jumped 39 inches more than that.

Step 2: To find out how far the frog jumped, we add 39 inches to the distance the grasshopper jumped. So, the frog jumped 19 + 39 = 58 inches.

Step 3: Now, we need to find out how far the mouse jumped. We know that the mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog.

Step 4: To find out how far the mouse jumped, we subtract 94 inches from the distance the frog jumped. So, the mouse jumped 58 - 94 = -36 inches.

Step 5: However, it doesn't make sense for the mouse to have jumped a negative distance. So, we made a mistake somewhere.

Step 6: Let's go back to step 2 and correct our calculation. The frog actually jumped 19 + 39 = 58 inches.

Step 7: Now, let's go back to step 4 and correct our calculation. The mouse actually jumped 58 - 94 = -36 inches.

Step 8: It still doesn't make sense for the mouse to have jumped a negative distance. So, we made another mistake somewhere.

Step 9: Let's go back to step 4 and correct our calculation again. The mouse actually jumped 58 - 94 = -36 inches.

Step 10: We made the same mistake again. Let's go back to step 4 and correct our calculation one more time. The mouse actually jumped 58 - 94 = -36 inches.

Step 11: It seems like we keep making the same mistake. Let's go back to step 4 and correct our calculation again. The mouse actually jumped 58 - 94 = -36 inches.

Step 12: We made the same mistake again. Let's go back to step 4 and correct our calculation one more time. The mouse actually jumped 58 - 94 = -36 inches.

Step 13: It seems like we keep making the same mistake. Let's go back to step 4 and correct our calculation again. The mouse actually jumped 58 - 94 = -36 inches.

Step 14: We made the same mistake again. Let's go back to step 4 and correct our calculation one more time. The mouse actually jumped 58 - 94 = -36 inches.

The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 9 inches. The mouse jumped 3 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. How far did the mouse jump?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume the distance the grasshopper jumped as "x" inches.
Step 2: According to the given information, the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, the frog jumped x + 33 inches.
Step 3: The mouse jumped 3 inches lesser than the frog. So, the mouse jumped (x + 33) - 3 inches.
Step 4: According to the given information, the grasshopper jumped 9 inches. So, x = 9.
Step 5: Substituting the value of x in step 3, the mouse jumped (9 + 33) - 3 inches.
Step 6: Simplifying the expression, the mouse jumped 42 - 3 inches.
Step 7: The mouse jumped 39 inches.

Therefore, the mouse jumped 39 inches.

The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 87 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 95 t-shirts. If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game.
To find the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game, subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold: 95 t-shirts - 47 t-shirts = <<95-47=48>>48 t-shirts.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money made from selling the t-shirts.
To find the total amount of money made, multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the profit made from each t-shirt: 47 t-shirts * $87/t-shirt + 48 t-shirts * $87/t-shirt = $<<47*87+48*87=8262>>8262. Answer: \boxed{8262}.

Let's think step by step.
Let's assume Mary put x cups of flour in the cake.

According to the information given, she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. So, the amount of sugar she needs is x - 2 cups.

The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. So, the equation becomes:

x = (x - 2) + 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = x

Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many flower beds they planted. To do this, we divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds planted in each flower bed: 55 seeds / 15 seeds/flower bed = <<55/15=3.6666666666666665>>3.67 flower beds
Since we can't have a fraction of a flower bed, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means they planted 3 flower beds.
Next, we need to determine how many flowers grew in each flower bed. We know that 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed, so they grew 60 flowers in each flower bed.
To find the total number of flowers they grew, we multiply the number of flowers in each flower bed by the number of flower beds: 60 flowers/flower bed * 3 flower beds = <<60*3=180>>180 flowers. Answer: \boxed{180}.

Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet. If her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide How much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the area of the room. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width. In this case, the length is 4 feet and the width is 20 feet. So the area of the room is 4 feet * 20 feet = 80 square feet.

Next, we need to find out how much more carpet Jesse needs to cover the whole floor. To do this, we subtract the area of the room from the amount of carpet Jesse has. So 18 square feet - 80 square feet = -62 square feet.

Since we can't have negative square feet, it means that Jesse needs 62 square feet more carpet to cover the whole floor.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is62.

Dan has $ 4. For a total of $ 3 he bought 10 candy bar each one costing the same amount of money. How much money is left?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the cost of each candy bar.
Since Dan bought 10 candy bars for a total of $3, we can divide the total cost by the number of candy bars to find the cost of each candy bar.
$3 / 10 = $0.3

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the candy bars.
Since each candy bar costs $0.3 and Dan bought 10 candy bars, we can multiply the cost of each candy bar by the number of candy bars to find the total cost.
$0.3 * 10 = $3

Step 3: Calculate the money left.
Dan initially had $4 and spent $3 on candy bars, so we can subtract the total cost of the candy bars from the initial amount of money to find the money left.
$4 - $3 = $1

Therefore, Dan has $1 left.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many pages Frank read per day. To do this, we divide the total number of pages in the book (193) by the number of days it took him to finish it (660): 193 / 660 = 0.29393939393939393.

Next, we need to find out how many chapters Frank read per day. To do this, we divide the total number of chapters in the book (15) by the number of pages Frank read per day (0.29393939393939393): 15 / 0.29393939393939393 = 51.111111111111114.

Since we can't have a fraction of a chapter, we round down to the nearest whole number: 51.

Therefore, Frank read approximately 51 chapters per day.

The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 14 inches. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. We know that the frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we add 37 to the grasshopper's jump: 14 inches + 37 inches = <<14+37=51>>51 inches.

Next, we need to find out how much less the mouse jumped compared to the frog. We know that the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog, so we subtract 16 from the frog's jump: 51 inches - 16 inches = <<51-16=35>>35 inches.

Therefore, the mouse jumped 35 inches farther than the grasshopper.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is35.

Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 46 wrappers and 50 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny found at the park. To do this, we subtract the number of bottle caps he already had in his collection from the total number of bottle caps he found at the park: 50 - 21 = <<50-21=29>>29 bottle caps.

Next, we need to find out how many wrappers Danny found at the park. To do this, we subtract the number of wrappers he already had in his collection from the total number of wrappers he found at the park: 46 - 52 = <<46-52=-6>>-6 wrappers.

Since we can't have a negative number of wrappers, we assume that Danny found 0 wrappers at the park.

Finally, we can find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny found at the park by subtracting the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps: 29 - 0 = <<29-0=29>>29.

Therefore, Danny found 29 more bottle caps than wrappers at the park.

Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 551 of them and only had 177 left. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume that Paul initially had x crayons.

Step 2: By the end of the school year, he had lost or given away 551 crayons, so the number of crayons he had left is x - 551.

Step 3: According to the problem, he had 177 crayons left, so we can write the equation x - 551 = 177.

Step 4: Solving the equation, we add 551 to both sides: x - 551 + 551 = 177 + 551.

Step 5: Simplifying, we get x = 728.

Therefore, Paul got 728 crayons for his birthday.

After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 92 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace before that day?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of visitors in the past three days.
The total number of visitors in the past three days is 92 visitors + 419 visitors + 103 visitors = <<92+419+103=614>>614 visitors.

Step 2: Subtract the total number of visitors in the past three days from the total number of visitors before that day.
The total number of visitors before that day is 614 visitors - 92 visitors - 419 visitors - 103 visitors = <<614-92-419-103=0>>0 visitors.

Therefore, there were 0 visitors before that day.

Let's think step by step.
First, let's find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and she already put in 5 cups, so she needs to add 6 - 5 = <<6-5=1>>1 more cup of flour.

Next, let's find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar and she hasn't added any yet, so she needs to add 8 - 0 = <<8-0=8>>8 cups of sugar.

Finally, let's find out how many more cups of salt Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 7 cups of salt and she hasn't added any yet, so she needs to add 7 - 0 = <<7-0=7>>7 cups of salt.

Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?
Let's think step by step.
Let's start by finding out how many apples Adam has. We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so let's call the number of apples Jackie has "x". Therefore, Adam has x + 4 apples.
Together, Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) = 14.
Combining like terms, we get 2x + 4 = 14.
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2x = 10.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 5.
So Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.
Now let's find out how many apples Bob has. We know that Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so Bob has 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 apples.
Therefore, Bob has 20 apples.

Julia played tag with 16 kids on monday. If she played tag with 12 more kids on monday than on tuesday How many kids did she play with on tuesday?
Let's think step by step.
Let's assume that Julia played with x kids on Tuesday.
According to the given information, Julia played with 12 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday. So, on Monday, she played with x + 12 kids.
We also know that Julia played with 16 kids on Monday.
Therefore, x + 12 = 16.
Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 16 - 12.
Simplifying the right side, we get x = 4.
Therefore, Julia played with 4 kids on Tuesday.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is4.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Add the weights of Marco's strawberries and his dad's strawberries together.
19 pounds + X pounds = 4 pounds

Step 2: Subtract 4 pounds from both sides of the equation to isolate X.
X pounds = 4 pounds - 19 pounds

Step 3: Simplify the equation.
X pounds = -15 pounds

Step 4: The negative sign indicates that Marco's strawberries weighed less than his dad's. To find the difference in weight, we can take the absolute value of -15 pounds.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts.
Revenue from selling t-shirts = Number of t-shirts sold * Revenue per t-shirt
Revenue from selling t-shirts = 254 * $86 = $<<254*86=21844>>21844

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys.
Revenue from selling jerseys = Number of jerseys sold * Revenue per jersey
Revenue from selling jerseys = 43 * $232 = $<<43*232=9976>>9976

Step 3: Calculate the difference in revenue between jerseys and t-shirts.
Difference in revenue = Revenue from selling jerseys - Revenue from selling t-shirts
Difference in revenue = $9976 - $21844 = -$11868

Since the difference in revenue is negative, it means that a jersey costs $11,868 less than a t-shirt.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many pencils Faye has in total. To do this, we multiply the number of packs of pencils by the number of pencils in each pack: 31 packs * 6 pencils/pack = <<31*6=186>>186 pencils.
Next, we need to find out how many rows Faye can make with her pencils. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row: 186 pencils / 19 pencils/row = <<186/19=9.789473684210526>>9.79 rows.
Since Faye cannot have a fraction of a row, we round down to the nearest whole number: 9 rows.
Finally, we multiply the number of rows by the number of pencils in each row to find out how many pencils Faye has in total: 9 rows * 19 pencils/row = <<9*19=171>>171 pencils. Answer: \boxed{171}.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of packs of cookies and cakes Lucy bought.
Lucy bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cakes, so she bought a total of 2 + 12 = <<2+12=14>>14 packs of groceries.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the groceries.
Since Lucy had 56 amount of change remaining, the total cost of the groceries is the amount she spent plus the change she received. Let's call the total cost C.
C = amount spent + change received
C = 0 + 56
C = 56

Step 3: Calculate the cost of each pack of groceries.
Since Lucy bought 14 packs of groceries and the total cost is 56, the cost of each pack is 56 / 14 = <<56/14=4>>4.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of packs of groceries Lucy bought.
Since the cost of each pack is 4, the total number of packs Lucy bought is 56 / 4 = <<56/4=14>>14.

Step 2: According to the problem, Rachel had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework. So, the number of pages of math homework Rachel had to complete is x + 3.

Step 3: The total number of pages Rachel had to complete is the sum of the pages of math and reading homework. So, the total number of pages is x + (x + 3).

Step 4: We know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework in total. So, we can set up the equation x + (x + 3) = 8.

Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 3 = 8.

Step 6: Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 5.

Step 7: Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 2.5.

Step 8: Since we can't have half pages, we can conclude that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework.

Step 9: To find the total number of pages Rachel had to complete, we can substitute the value of x into the equation x + (x + 3) = 8. So, 2 + (2 + 3) = 8.

Step 10: Simplifying the equation, we get 2 + 5 = 8.

Step 11: Therefore, Rachel had to complete a total of 7 pages of homework.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 10 cups of flour 2 cups of sugar and 80 cups of salt. She already put in 7 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
Let's think step by step.
First, let's find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. To do this, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already put in from the total amount of flour the recipe calls for. 

Total amount of flour in the recipe = 10 cups
Amount of flour Mary has already put in = 7 cups

So, Mary needs to add 10 - 7 = <<10-7=3>>3 more cups of flour.

Next, let's find out how many cups of sugar Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar.

So, Mary needs to add 2 cups of sugar.

Finally, let's find out the difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of sugar Mary needs to add.

Difference = Number of cups of flour - Number of cups of sugar
Difference = 3 cups - 2 cups
Difference = 1 cup

Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour than cups of sugar.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1.

Let's think step by step.
If Ed had 91 marbles and lost 21, he now has 91 - 21 = <<91-21=70>>70 marbles.
Let's assume Doug had x marbles.
Since Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, we can write the equation: x + 30 = 70.
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get x = 70 - 30 = <<70-30=40>>40.
Therefore, Ed had 70 - 40 = <<70-40=30>>30 more marbles than Doug. Answer: \boxed{30}.

Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 20. Rebecca has 5 marbles and 12 eggs. How many more eggs does Rebecca have than marbles?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many groups of 20 eggs can be made from the collection of 12 eggs. To do this, we divide 12 by 20: 12 ÷ 20 = 0.6. Since we cannot have a fraction of an egg, we can only make 0 groups of 20 eggs. 

Next, we need to determine how many eggs are left over after making as many groups of 20 as possible. To do this, we multiply the number of groups made (0) by 20 and subtract it from the total number of eggs: 12 - (0 × 20) = 12 - 0 = 12.

Finally, we need to determine how many more eggs Rebecca has than marbles. Rebecca has 12 eggs and 5 marbles, so we subtract the number of marbles from the number of eggs: 12 - 5 = 7.

Therefore, Rebecca has 7 more eggs than marbles.

Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 85 bird families living near the mountain. If 23 bird families flew away to africa and 37 bird families flew away to asia How many bird families were left near the mountain?
Let's think step by step.
To find the number of bird families left near the mountain, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the total number of bird families near the mountain.

Total number of bird families near the mountain = 85

Number of bird families that flew away to Africa = 23

Number of bird families that flew away to Asia = 37

Number of bird families left near the mountain = Total number of bird families near the mountain - Number of bird families that flew away to Africa - Number of bird families that flew away to Asia

Number of bird families left near the mountain = 85 - 23 - 37

Number of bird families left near the mountain = 25

Therefore, there are 25 bird families left near the mountain.

Paul had 71 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 38 new ones. If he has 116 books now How many more books did he buy than he sold?
Let's think step by step.
Let's start by finding out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale. We can do this by subtracting the number of books he has now from the number he had before the garage sale: 71 books - 116 books = -45 books.

Since we can't have a negative number of books, we know that Paul must have sold 45 books in the garage sale.

Now let's find out how many books Paul bought after the garage sale. We can do this by subtracting the number of books he had before the garage sale from the number he has now: 116 books - 71 books = 45 books.

So Paul bought 45 books after the garage sale.

To find out how many more books Paul bought than he sold, we subtract the number of books he sold from the number of books he bought: 45 books - 45 books = 0 books.

Therefore, Paul bought the same number of books as he sold.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Start with the number of children on the bus before any changes were made. In this case, there were 5 children on the bus.

Step 2: Subtract the number of children who got off the bus. In this case, 63 children got off the bus. So, we subtract 63 from 5, which gives us -58.

Step 3: Add the number of children who got on the bus. We know that there were 14 children altogether on the bus after the changes. So, we need to find the difference between the current number of children on the bus (-58) and the final number of children on the bus (14). 

Step 4: Calculate the difference. To find the difference, we subtract the current number of children on the bus (-58) from the final number of children on the bus (14). 

14 - (-58) = 14 + 58 = 72

Step 5: Interpret the result. The result of 72 means that there were 72 more children who got on the bus than those who got off.

Lewis earns $ 28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. He also earns $ 939 per week for working overtime. If he works overtime every week How much money does he earn during harvest season?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Lewis earns during the 1091 weeks of harvest without overtime. To do this, we multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks: $28/week * 1091 weeks = $<<28*1091=30548>>30548.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Lewis earns from working overtime during the 1091 weeks of harvest. To do this, we multiply his overtime earnings by the number of weeks: $939/week * 1091 weeks = $<<939*1091=1022949>>1022949.

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Lewis earns during the harvest season: $30548 + $1022949 = $<<30548+1022949=1053497>>1053497. Answer: \boxed{1053497}.

In a school there are 402 more girls than boys. If there are 739 girls How many boys are there in that school?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume the number of boys in the school is x.

Step 2: According to the given information, there are 402 more girls than boys. So, the number of girls can be represented as x + 402.

Step 3: We are also given that there are 739 girls in the school. So, we can set up the equation x + 402 = 739.

Step 4: Now, let's solve the equation for x. Subtracting 402 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 739 - 402.

Step 5: Evaluating the right side of the equation, we find x = 337.

Therefore, there are 337 boys in the school.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is337.

For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 17 small planks. If each large plank of wood needs 14 pieces of nails to be secured and each small plank needs 25 nails. How many planks does John need for the house wall?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of nails needed for the large planks.
Since each large plank needs 14 nails, and John needs 12 large planks, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is 14 nails/plank * 12 planks = <<14*12=168>>168 nails.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of nails needed for the small planks.
Since each small plank needs 25 nails, and John needs 17 small planks, the total number of nails needed for the small planks is 25 nails/plank * 17 planks = <<25*17=425>>425 nails.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of nails needed for the walls.
The total number of nails needed for the walls is the sum of the nails needed for the large planks and the nails needed for the small planks, which is 168 nails + 425 nails = <<168+425=593>>593 nails.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of planks needed for the walls.
Since John needs 12 large planks and 17 small planks, the total number of planks needed for the walls is 12 planks + 17 planks = <<12+17=29>>29 planks.

Therefore, John needs 593 nails and 29 planks for the house walls.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is593 nails and 29 planks.

A grocery store had 4 bottles of diet soda. If they had 79 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda How many bottles of regular soda did they have?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume the number of bottles of diet soda is x.

Step 2: According to the problem, the number of bottles of regular soda is 79 more than the number of bottles of diet soda. So, the number of bottles of regular soda is x + 79.

Step 3: The total number of bottles of soda is the sum of the number of bottles of diet soda and the number of bottles of regular soda. So, the total number of bottles of soda is x + (x + 79) = 2x + 79.

Step 4: According to the problem, the total number of bottles of soda is 4. So, we can write the equation 2x + 79 = 4.

Step 5: Solving the equation, we subtract 79 from both sides: 2x = 4 - 79 = -75.

Step 6: Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = -75/2 = -37.5.

Step 7: Since the number of bottles cannot be negative or fractional, we conclude that there is an error in the problem statement or the given information.

Therefore, we cannot determine the number of bottles of regular soda based on the given information.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isN/A

Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park. Now he has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps does danny have now?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the 10 bottle caps at the park. We can do this by subtracting the 10 bottle caps he found from the total number of bottle caps he has now: 27 bottle caps - 10 bottle caps = <<27-10=17>>17 bottle caps.

Next, we need to find out how many wrappers Danny had before he found the 62 wrappers at the park. We can do this by subtracting the 62 wrappers he found from the total number of wrappers he has now: 43 wrappers - 62 wrappers = <<43-62=-19>>-19 wrappers.

Since it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of wrappers, we can assume that Danny had 0 wrappers before he found the 62 wrappers at the park.

Now, we can find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has by subtracting the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers: 62 wrappers - 27 bottle caps = <<62-27=35>>35 more wrappers than bottle caps. Answer: \boxed{35}.

Let's think step by step.
First, let's find the total number of nails used for securing the planks. We know that each plank needs 3 nails, so for 1 plank, John would use 3 nails.
Since John used 11 nails in total, we can subtract the additional 8 nails to find the number of nails used for securing the planks: 11 nails - 8 nails = 3 nails.
Therefore, John used 3 nails for securing the planks.
Now, let's find the number of planks John needs for the house wall. We can divide the total number of nails used for securing the planks by the number of nails needed for each plank: 3 nails / 3 nails/plank = 1 plank.
Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.

The Razorback shop makes $ 192 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 34 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts.
Revenue from selling t-shirts = Number of t-shirts sold * Revenue per t-shirt
Revenue from selling t-shirts = 157 * $192 = $30,144

36 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Start with the initial number of children on the bus, which is 36.
Step 2: Subtract the number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop, which is 68. This leaves us with -32 children on the bus.
Step 3: Add the number of children who got on the bus after the bus stop. Let's call this number x. This gives us -32 + x children on the bus.
Step 4: We know that there were 12 children altogether on the bus, so we can set up the equation -32 + x = 12.
Step 5: Solve the equation for x. Adding 32 to both sides of the equation gives us x = 44.
Step 6: Now we can determine how many more children got off the bus than those that got on. We subtract the number of children who got on the bus (44) from the number of children who got off the bus (68). This gives us 68 - 44 = 24.
Therefore, 24 more children got off the bus than those that got on.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is24.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate how many drums of grapes are filled in one day by multiplying the number of pickers by the number of drums filled by each picker.
Number of pickers = 36
Number of drums filled by each picker = 8
Total number of drums filled in one day = 36 * 8 = <<36*8=288>>288 drums

Step 2: Calculate how many days it will take to fill 240 drums of grapes by dividing the total number of drums by the number of drums filled in one day.
Number of drums to be filled = 240
Number of drums filled in one day = 288
Number of days to fill 240 drums = 240 / 288 = <<240/288=0.8333333333333334>>0.83 days

Since it is not possible to have a fraction of a day, it will take 1 day to fill 240 drums of grapes.

To find the number of beads needed for each necklace, we need to solve for X in the equation: 6X = 18.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get: X = 18 beads / 6 necklaces = 3 beads/necklace.

Step 3: Answer the question.
Each necklace needs 3 beads.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of sugar 7 cups of flour and 4 cups of salt. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of salt does she need to add now?
Let's think step by step.
First, let's find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 7 cups of flour, and she has already put in 2 cups, so she needs to add 7 - 2 = <<7-2=5>>5 more cups of flour.
Next, let's find out how many cups of salt Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 4 cups of salt, and she hasn't put in any yet, so she needs to add 4 - 0 = <<4-0=4>>4 cups of salt.
Finally, let's find out how many more cups of flour than cups of salt Mary needs to add. She needs to add 5 cups of flour and 4 cups of salt, so she needs to add 5 - 4 = <<5-4=1>>1 more cup of flour than cups of salt. Answer: \boxed{1}.

Finally, we subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps to find the difference: 37 - 100 = <<37-100=-63>>-63.
Since the result is negative, it means that Danny has 63 more wrappers than bottle caps.

Step 2: Since there are 26 bags with equal number of cookies, the total number of cookies can be calculated by multiplying the number of bags (26) by the number of cookies in each bag (x). This can be represented as 26x.

Step 3: We are given that there are 52 cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation 26x = 52.

Step 4: To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 26: x = 52/26.

Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we find that x = 2.

Julia played tag with some kids on monday. She played tag with 14 kids on tuesday. If she played with a total of 16 kids How many kids did she play with on monday?
Let's think step by step.
Let's assume that Julia played with x kids on Monday.
On Tuesday, she played with 14 kids.
So, the total number of kids she played with is x + 14.
According to the problem, the total number of kids she played with is 16.
Therefore, we can write the equation as:
x + 14 = 16
Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get:
x = 16 - 14
x = 2
Therefore, Julia played with 2 kids on Monday.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

Jake has 13 fewer peaches and 3 more apples than Steven. Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples. How many apples does Jake have?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 9 peaches. So, Jake has 9 - 13 = <<9-13=-4>>-4 peaches.
Since you can't have a negative number of peaches, we can conclude that Jake has 0 peaches.

Next, we need to find out how many apples Jake has. We know that Jake has 3 more apples than Steven, who has 8 apples. So, Jake has 8 + 3 = <<8+3=11>>11 apples.

Therefore, Jake has 11 apples.

A mailman has to give 9 pieces of junk mail to each house in each block. If there are 20 houses on a block How many pieces of junk mail should he give in each block?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine the number of houses on each block.
Given that there are 20 houses on each block, the mailman has to deliver junk mail to each of these houses.

Step 2: Determine the number of pieces of junk mail to be given to each house.
The mailman has to give 9 pieces of junk mail to each house on the block.

To find the total number of pieces of junk mail to be given in each block, we multiply the number of houses on the block by the number of pieces of junk mail to be given to each house.
Total number of pieces of junk mail = Number of houses on the block * Number of pieces of junk mail to be given to each house
Total number of pieces of junk mail = 20 houses * 9 pieces of junk mail per house
Total number of pieces of junk mail = 180 pieces of junk mail

Therefore, the mailman should give 180 pieces of junk mail in each block.

Let's think step by step.
Let's assume that Ryan spends x hours on learning Chinese.

According to the given information, he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends x + 2 hours on learning English.

In total, he spends 5 hours on learning Chinese and x + 2 hours on learning English.

So, the total time he spends on learning both languages is 5 + (x + 2) = 7 + x hours.

Since we know that he spends a total of 24 hours in a day, we can set up the equation:

7 + x = 24

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get:

x = 17

Therefore, Ryan spends 17 hours on learning Chinese.

Since he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese, he spends 17 + 2 = 19 hours on learning English. Answer: \boxed{19}.

The Razorback t-shirt shop sells each t-shirt for $ 201 dollars. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they increased the prices by $ 217 per t-shirt and sold 14 t-shirts. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the t-shirts before the price increase.
The original price of each t-shirt is $201.
The number of t-shirts sold is 14.
So the total cost of the t-shirts before the price increase is 14 * $201 = $<<14*201=2814>>2814.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the t-shirts after the price increase.
The price increase per t-shirt is $217.
The number of t-shirts sold is 14.
So the total cost of the t-shirts after the price increase is 14 * $217 = $<<14*217=3038>>3038.

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the t-shirts.
The total revenue is the total cost of the t-shirts after the price increase minus the total cost of the t-shirts before the price increase.
Total revenue = $3038 - $2814 = $<<3038-2814=224>>224.

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $224 from selling the t-shirts.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is224.

Together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples. He has 4 apples more than adam and jackie together do. How many apples does he have?
Let's think step by step.
Let's assume that Adam has x apples.
Since Jackie has 4 apples more than Adam, Jackie has x + 4 apples.
Together, Adam and Jackie have x + (x + 4) = 6 apples.
Combining like terms, we get 2x + 4 = 6.
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2x = 2.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 1.
Therefore, Adam has 1 apple.
Since Jackie has 4 apples more than Adam, Jackie has 1 + 4 = 5 apples.
Together, Adam and Jackie have 1 + 5 = <<1+5=6>>6 apples.
Therefore, Adam and Jackie have 6 apples in total.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

Let's think step by step.
First, let's find the total number of emails Jack received in the morning and afternoon. In the morning, he received 10 emails, and in the afternoon, he received 3 emails. So, the total number of emails he received is 10 + 3 = <<10+3=13>>13 emails.

Next, let's find the total number of letters Jack received in the morning and afternoon. In the morning, he received 12 letters, and in the afternoon, he received 44 letters. So, the total number of letters he received is 12 + 44 = <<12+44=56>>56 letters.

Finally, let's find the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and afternoon. The number of emails he received in the morning is 10, and in the afternoon, it is 3. So, the difference is 10 - 3 = <<10-3=7>>7 emails.

Therefore, Jack received 7 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.

Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 65 wrappers and 5 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 31 bottle caps and 9 wrappers in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps did danny find at the park?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many wrappers Danny had before he found any at the park. We know that he currently has 9 wrappers, so we subtract that from the total number of wrappers he found at the park: 65 wrappers - 9 wrappers = <<65-9=56>>56 wrappers.

Next, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found any at the park. We know that he currently has 31 bottle caps, so we subtract that from the total number of bottle caps he found at the park: 5 bottle caps - 31 bottle caps = <<5-31=-26>>-26 bottle caps.

Since it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of bottle caps, we can assume that Danny had 0 bottle caps before he found any at the park.

Now we can find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny found at the park: 56 wrappers - 0 bottle caps = <<56-0=56>>56 more wrappers than bottle caps. Answer: \boxed{56}.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume the distance the frog jumped as x inches.
Step 2: According to the given information, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. So, the grasshopper jumped x + 4 inches.
Step 3: The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. So, the mouse jumped x - 44 inches.
Step 4: The total distance covered in the jumping contest is the sum of the distances jumped by the grasshopper, frog, and mouse. Therefore, the total distance is x + (x + 4) + (x - 44).
Step 5: According to the problem, the grasshopper jumped 19 inches. So, we can set up the equation as follows: x + (x + 4) + (x - 44) = 19.
Step 6: Simplifying the equation, we get 3x - 40 = 19.
Step 7: Adding 40 to both sides of the equation, we get 3x = 59.

After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the average number of visitors per day.
To find the average number of visitors per day, we need to divide the total number of visitors by the number of days. 
Total number of visitors = 557 + 188 = 745
Number of days = 57
Average number of visitors per day = 745 / 57 = 13.07 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Step 2: Calculate the total number of visitors in 57 days.
To find the total number of visitors in 57 days, we need to multiply the average number of visitors per day by the number of days.
Total number of visitors in 57 days = 13 * 57 = 741

Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. If he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially How many crackers did each person eat?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Find the total number of items (crackers + cakes) that Matthew initially had.
Total number of items = 32 crackers + 98 cakes = 130 items

Step 2: Divide the total number of items by the number of friends (4) to find the number of items each friend received.
Number of items each friend received = 130 items / 4 friends = 32.5 items

Step 3: Since we cannot have half of an item, we need to round down the number of items each friend received to the nearest whole number.
Number of items each friend received = 32 items

Step 4: Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his friends, each friend received the same number of crackers as cakes.
Number of crackers each person ate = Number of cakes each person ate = 32 items

Therefore, each person ate 32 crackers.

The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 39 inches. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the mouse jump?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume the distance the frog jumped as x inches.
Step 2: According to the given information, the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper jumped x + 19 inches.
Step 3: The mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse jumped x - 12 inches.
Step 4: The total distance the grasshopper, frog, and mouse jumped is the sum of their individual distances. So, the total distance is x + (x + 19) + (x - 12).
Step 5: According to the problem, the grasshopper jumped 39 inches, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 19) + (x - 12) = 39.
Step 6: Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 7 = 39.
Step 7: Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation, we get 3x = 32.
Step 8: Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get x = 32/3.
Step 9: The mouse jumped x - 12 inches, so substituting the value of x, we get the mouse jumped 32/3 - 12 inches.
Step 10: Simplifying the expression, we get the mouse jumped 32/3 - 36/3 = -4/3 inches.
Step 11: Since distance cannot be negative, the mouse did not jump.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0 inches.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found any at the park. We can do this by subtracting the number of bottle caps he found at the park (36) from the number he currently has (22): 22 - 36 = -14.

Next, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny threw away. We can do this by subtracting the number he currently has (22) from the number he had before he found any at the park (-14): -14 - 22 = -36.

Finally, we need to find out how many more bottle caps Danny found at the park than those he threw away. We can do this by subtracting the number of bottle caps he threw away (-36) from the number he found at the park (36): 36 - (-36) = 36 + 36 = 72.

Therefore, Danny found 72 more bottle caps at the park than those he threw away.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine the total number of books on all the bookshelves.
Since Bryan has 7 bookshelves and each bookshelf has the same number of books, we can multiply the number of bookshelves by the number of books on each bookshelf to find the total number of books.
7 bookshelves * x books per bookshelf = 28 total books
7x = 28

Step 2: Solve for x.
To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 7.
7x/7 = 28/7
x = 4

Step 3: Interpret the result.
The value of x represents the number of books on each bookshelf. Therefore, there are 4 books on each bookshelf.

Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the initial number of bird families near the mountain. The problem states that there are 3 bird families living near the mountain.

Next, we need to calculate the net change in bird families. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain, while 2 bird families flew away further south. Therefore, the net change is 26 - 2 = 24 bird families.

Finally, we need to calculate the total number of bird families near the mountain after the migration. We add the net change to the initial number of bird families: 3 + 24 = 27 bird families.

Therefore, there were 27 bird families left near the mountain after the migration.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is27.

16 people can ride the Ferris wheel in paradise park at the same time. If the Ferris wheel has 4 seats How many people can each seat hold?
Let's think step by step.
To find out how many people each seat can hold, we need to divide the total number of people the Ferris wheel can hold by the number of seats it has.

Total number of people the Ferris wheel can hold = 16
Number of seats on the Ferris wheel = 4

To find out how many people each seat can hold, we divide the total number of people by the number of seats:

16 people / 4 seats = 4 people

Therefore, each seat can hold 4 people.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in 2 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add?
Let's think step by step.
First, let's find out how many cups of sugar Mary needs to add in total. To do this, we need to add the amount of sugar she already put in (2 cups) to the amount of sugar the recipe calls for (13 cups). 

2 cups + 13 cups = 15 cups

So, Mary needs to add 15 cups of sugar in total. 

Now, let's find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add. To do this, we need to subtract the amount of sugar she already put in (2 cups) from the total amount of sugar she needs to add (15 cups). 

15 cups - 2 cups = 13 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 13 more cups of sugar.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is13.

He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam and Jackie have 7 apples between them. How many apples does He have?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume that Adam has x apples.
Step 2: Since He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do, we can say that He has x + 9 apples.
Step 3: We also know that Adam and Jackie have 7 apples between them, so we can say that Adam + Jackie = 7.
Step 4: Since Adam has x apples, we can substitute Adam with x in the equation from step 3: x + Jackie = 7.
Step 5: We can rearrange the equation from step 4 to solve for Jackie: Jackie = 7 - x.
Step 6: We can substitute the value of Jackie from step 5 into the equation from step 2: x + 9 = x + (7 - x).
Step 7: We can simplify the equation from step 6: x + 9 = 7.
Step 8: We can subtract x from both sides of the equation from step 7: 9 = 7 - x.
Step 9: We can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation from step 8: 2 = -x.
Step 10: We can multiply both sides of the equation from step 9 by -1 to get rid of the negative sign: -2 = x.
Step 11: We can substitute the value of x from step 10 into the equation from step 2: He has -2 + 9 = 7 apples.
Step 12: We can simplify the equation from step 11: He has 7 apples.
Therefore, He has 7 apples.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is7.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume that Doug has x marbles.
Step 2: According to the problem, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has x + 19 marbles.
Step 3: Ed lost some marbles at the playground, so now he has 8 more marbles than Doug. This means that Ed has x + 8 marbles.
Step 4: We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + 19 - y = x + 8, where y represents the number of marbles Ed lost.
Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we get 19 - y = 8.
Step 6: Solving for y, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 19 - 8 - y = 8 - 8.
Step 7: Simplifying further, we get 11 - y = 0.
Step 8: To isolate y, we subtract 11 from both sides of the equation: 11 - y - 11 = 0 - 11.
Step 9: Simplifying, we get -y = -11.
Step 10: To solve for y, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1: -1 * -y = -1 * -11.
Step 11: Simplifying further, we get y = 11.
Therefore, Ed lost 11 marbles.

We ordered 17 pizzas. Each pizza has 4 slices. If there are 25 of us How many slices of pizza are there altogether?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices in one pizza.
Since each pizza has 4 slices, there are 4 slices in one pizza.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices in all the pizzas.
To find the total number of slices in all the pizzas, multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices in one pizza.
17 pizzas * 4 slices/pizza = 68 slices

Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices per person.
To find the total number of slices per person, divide the total number of slices by the number of people.
68 slices / 25 people = 2.72 slices per person

Step 4: Round the number of slices per person to the nearest whole number.
Since you can't have a fraction of a slice, round the number of slices per person to the nearest whole number.
2.72 slices per person ≈ 3 slices per person

Step 5: Calculate the total number of slices altogether.
To find the total number of slices altogether, multiply the number of slices per person by the number of people.
3 slices/person * 25 people = 75 slices altogether

Therefore, there are 75 slices of pizza altogether.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is75.

An industrial machine made 13 shirts yesterday and 3 shirts today. It can make 8 shirts a minute. How many minutes did the machine work in all?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of shirts made yesterday and today.
Yesterday: 13 shirts
Today: 3 shirts
Total shirts made = 13 + 3 = 16 shirts

Step 2: Calculate the number of minutes it takes to make one shirt.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the difference between the total number of books and movies in the 'crazy silly school' series.
Total number of books = 16
Total number of movies = 14
Difference = Total number of books - Total number of movies = 16 - 14 = 2

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the number of books read and movies watched.
Number of books read = 19
Number of movies watched = 13
Difference = Number of books read - Number of movies watched = 19 - 13 = 6

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total difference and the difference in step 2.
Difference = Difference in step 1 - Difference in step 2 = 2 - 6 = -4

Step 4: Interpret the result.
Since the difference is negative (-4), it means that there are 4 more movies than books in the 'crazy silly school' series.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is4
