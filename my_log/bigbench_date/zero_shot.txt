One week ago from today would be 7 days ago. Since Jane ate one egg per day, she would have eaten 7 eggs in 7 days. Therefore, she would have 40 - 7 = <<40-7=33>>33 eggs left. 

Since Jane ate one egg per day starting from May 9th, 2017, she would have started eating her last egg on May 9th, 2017 + 33 days = May 42nd, 2017. 

However, May only has 31 days, so we need to subtract 31 from 42 to find the number of days into June. 42 - 31 = 11. 

Therefore, the date one week ago from today would be June 11th, 2017.

To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 1 day to the given date. Since December has 31 days, adding 1 day to 12/31/1929 would give us 01/01/1930. However, this date is not listed in the answer choices. 

To find the correct answer, we need to consider the leap year rule. A leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. 

Since 1929 is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year. Therefore, the next day after 12/31/1929 would be 01/01/1930.

Jane got her job in 2016. Today is her 3-year work anniversary. She still remember that on Dec 2, her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 03/21/2020 (B) 02/21/2020 (C) 11/22/2019 (D) 11/21/2019 (E) 11/20/2019 (F) 11/21/2080
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from today's date. Today is Jane's 3-year work anniversary, which means she started her job in 2016. Since we don't have the specific date, we can assume it is the same as today's date. 

Today's date is 2019, so 10 days ago would be 2019 - 10 = 2009. However, this is not a valid year, so we can eliminate answer choices (C), (D), (E), and (F).

Now we need to determine the month and day. Since today is Jane's 3-year work anniversary, we can subtract 3 years from today's date to find the date she started her job. 

2019 - 3 = 2016

So, Jane started her job in 2016. Since we don't have the specific date, we can assume it is the same as today's date. 

Therefore, the date 10 days ago is 11/21/2019.

The correct answer is (D) 11/21/2019.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(D) 11/21/2019

If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then the current year is 2014.

Since Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000, her birthday is on February 29th. Today is her 16th birthday, so the current year is 2016. 

To find the date 10 days ago, we subtract 10 from 29 to get 19. 

Therefore, the date 10 days ago is February 19th, 2016.

To find the date 10 days ago, we subtract 10 days from the current date. Since 2015 is coming in 36 hours, we can assume the current date is December 31, 2014. Subtracting 10 days from December 31, 2014, we get December 21, 2014. Therefore, the answer is (B) 12/20/2014.

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the current date. Since today is their golden wedding anniversary, which is 50 years after their wedding, we can calculate the current date by adding 50 years to their wedding date.

Jan 2, 1958 + 50 years = Jan 2, 2008

Now, we can subtract 10 days from Jan 2, 2008 to find the date 10 days ago.

Jan 2, 2008 - 10 days = Dec 23, 2007

Therefore, the date 10 days ago is 12/23/2007, which corresponds to answer choice (D).

Jane quited her job on Mar 20, 2020. 176 days have passed since then. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 06/19/2020 (B) 09/18/2020 (C) 09/30/2020 (D) 09/19/2020 (E) 09/20/2020
To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date. 

Since Jane quit her job on March 20, 2020, we can add 7 days to that date. 

March has 31 days, so we can subtract 31 - 20 = 11 days from the 7 days we need to add. 

This leaves us with 7 - 11 = -4 days. 

Since we have a negative number of days, we need to move to the previous month. 

February has 29 days in a leap year, so we can add 29 - 4 = 25 days to the date. 

This brings us to February 25, 2020. 

Therefore, one week from today would be February 25 + 7 = March 3, 2020.

Since Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009, we can count backwards to find the date of her previous visit. 

If today is her 5th visit, then her previous visit was 4 months ago. 

Counting backwards from October 2009, we have: 
October 2009
September 2009
August 2009
July 2009

Therefore, her previous visit was on July 16, 2009. 

To find the date yesterday, we subtract 1 day from July 16, 2009. 

Therefore, the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format is 07/15/2009.

If Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017, and ate one egg per day, then she would have consumed 31 eggs by May 31st, 2017. From June 1st, 2017, to June 30th, 2017, she would have consumed an additional 30 eggs. This brings the total number of eggs consumed to 61. Since she ran out of eggs today, we can subtract one day from the current date to find the date yesterday.

If the concert was scheduled to be on 06/01/1943 and was delayed by one day, it means that the concert took place on 06/02/1943. 

To find the date 10 days ago, we subtract 10 days from 06/02/1943. 

06/02/1943 - 10 days = 05/23/1943

Therefore, the date 10 days ago is 05/23/1943.

To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from 11/23/1933. Since there are 30 days in November, subtracting one month would give us 10/23/1933. However, this date is not one of the answer choices. 

To find the correct answer, we need to consider that the day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. This means that yesterday was 11/24/1933. Subtracting one month from this date gives us 10/24/1933. However, this date is also not one of the answer choices. 

Since neither 10/23/1933 nor 10/24/1933 are answer choices, it is likely that there is an error in the question or answer choices.

Since Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, her visits are exactly one month apart. Therefore, her 5th visit would be on the 16th of February 2010. 

To find the date one month before this, we subtract one month from February 16, 2010. 

Since January has 31 days, subtracting one month from February 16, 2010 gives us January 16, 2010.

Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from the October of 2009. It is her 5th visit to the bookstore today. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 02/17/2010 (B) 02/26/2010 (C) 11/17/2009 (D) 02/17/2096 (E) 02/14/2010 (F) 02/16/2010
Since Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, her visits occur every 30 days. Therefore, her 5th visit would occur 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 days after her first visit in October 2009.

To find the date of her 5th visit, we add 120 days to October 16, 2009. 

October has 31 days, so we subtract 31 from 120 to get 120 - 31 = 89 days remaining.

November has 30 days, so we subtract 30 from 89 to get 89 - 30 = 59 days remaining.

December has 31 days, so we subtract 31 from 59 to get 59 - 31 = 28 days remaining.

January has 31 days, so we subtract 31 from 28 to get 28 - 31 = -3 days remaining.

Since we have negative days remaining, we move to the next month, which is February. 

February has 28 days in 2010 (not a leap year), so we add 28 to -3 to get -3 + 28 = 25 days remaining.

Therefore, Jane's 5th visit to the bookstore is on February 25, 2010.

The date tomorrow would be February 26, 2010.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 02/26/2010.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(B) 02/26/2010.

If today is 3/5 and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower, then the first time she saw the meteor shower in 1973 must have been on a different date. Since it is her second time seeing the meteor shower in 1973, the first time must have been in a different year. 

Therefore, the date yesterday would be 3/4/1973.

Since Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000, her birthday is on February 29th. However, February 29th only occurs during leap years, which occur every 4 years. Therefore, Jane's birthday would not occur on February 29th in non-leap years. Since today is her 16th birthday, we can assume that it is not a leap year. Therefore, her birthday would have been on February 28th. 

To find the date yesterday, we subtract 1 day from February 28th. Therefore, the date yesterday would be February 27th.

To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the current date. Since today is their golden wedding anniversary, which is 50 years after their wedding date, we can calculate the current date by adding 50 years to Jan 2, 1958.

Jan 2, 1958 + 50 years = Jan 2, 2008

Now, to find the date a month ago, we subtract one month from Jan 2, 2008.

Jan 2, 2008 - 1 month = Dec 2, 2007

If the concert was scheduled for 06/01/1943 and was delayed by one day, it means that the concert took place on 06/02/1943. To find the date yesterday, we subtract one day from 06/02/1943. 

06/02/1943 - 1 day = 06/01/1943

To find the date 10 days ago, we subtract 10 days from April 10, 1985. 

April has 30 days, so 10 days ago would be April 10 - 10 = April 0. 

However, April 0 is not a valid date, so we need to borrow a day from the previous month. 

March has 31 days, so April 0 is equivalent to March 31.

In the UK, people usually put the day before the month when formatting the date. Therefore, today is 02/01/1987 to them. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 01/13/1987 (B) 12/24/1986 (C) 11/18/1986 (D) 12/23/1986 (E) 01/01/1987 (F) 12/21/1986
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from 02/01/1987. 

Starting with the day, we subtract 10 from 1, which gives us -9. Since we cannot have a negative day, we need to borrow from the month. 

Subtracting 1 from the month, we get 01. 

Now, we add the borrowed 31 days to the day, which gives us 31 - 9 = 22. 

Therefore, the date 10 days ago is 01/22/1987. 

Converting this to MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (F) 12/21/1986.

To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. Since today is their golden wedding anniversary, which means they have been married for 50 years, we can subtract 50 years from the current date. 

Jan 2, 1958 - 50 years = Jan 2, 2008

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is Jan 2, 2007.

To determine the date today, we need to subtract 36 hours from the current date. Since there are 24 hours in a day, subtracting 36 hours is equivalent to subtracting 1 day and 12 hours. 

If today is December 31, 2014, subtracting 1 day gives us December 30, 2014. Subtracting 12 hours gives us December 29, 2014.

Since Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, her visits are exactly one month apart. Therefore, if it is her 5th visit today, it means that she has been visiting the bookstore for 4 months. 

Starting from October 2009, the 4th month after October is January 2010. 

Therefore, the date 24 hours later will be January 17, 2010.

To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date. 

Since it is their 5-year anniversary today, we can calculate the current year by adding 5 to 1958: 1958 + 5 = 1963.

Now, let's subtract 7 days from today's date: 

Jan 2, 1963 - 7 days = Dec 26, 1962.

To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date. Since the given date is 12/31/1929, subtracting one month would give us 11/31/1929. However, November only has 30 days, so 11/31/1929 is not a valid date.

To find the date today, we need to add 176 days to March 20, 2020.

March has 31 days, so we can subtract 31 from 176 to get 145 days remaining.
April has 30 days, so we can subtract another 30 from 145 to get 115 days remaining.
May has 31 days, so we can subtract another 31 from 115 to get 84 days remaining.
June has 30 days, so we can subtract another 30 from 84 to get 54 days remaining.
July has 31 days, so we can subtract another 31 from 54 to get 23 days remaining.
August has 31 days, so we can subtract another 31 from 23 to get -8 days remaining.

Since we have a negative number of days remaining, we need to go back to the previous month, which is July. The date is 23 days into July.

Therefore, the date today is July 23, 2020, which is represented as 07/23/2020.

Since Jane bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017, and ate one per day, she would have finished all the eggs on June 17th, 2017. 

To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from June 17th, 2017. 

June has 30 days, so subtracting one month would give us May 17th, 2017.

Jane's first visit to the bookstore was on October 16, 2009. Since then, she has visited the bookstore on the 16th of each month. 

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the current date. 

Since today is her 5th visit to the bookstore, we can count backwards from today to find the date of her first visit. 

Today is October 16, 2010 (her 5th visit). 

Counting backwards, we have:
1st visit: October 16, 2009
2nd visit: September 16, 2010
3rd visit: August 16, 2010
4th visit: July 16, 2010
5th visit: June 16, 2010

Now, we can subtract 10 days from June 16, 2010 to find the date 10 days ago. 

June 16, 2010 - 10 days = June 6, 2010

Therefore, the date 10 days ago is 06/06/2010, which corresponds to answer choice (C) 02/06/2010.
