It was Sept. 1st, 2021 a week ago. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 09/22/2021 (B) 09/09/2021 (C) 09/08/2006 (D) 09/08/2021 (E) 09/07/2021 (F) 08/11/2021
Let's think step by step.
To find the date today, we need to count the number of days that have passed since September 1st, 2021. 

Since it was a week ago, we know that 7 days have passed. 

So, to find the date today, we add 7 days to September 1st, 2021. 

September 1st + 7 days = September 8th, 2021. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 09/08/2021.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(D) 09/08/2021.

May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to Jane, but that is actually ten years ago. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 08/26/2001 (B) 04/26/2007 (C) 05/01/2002 (D) 04/25/2002 (E) 04/18/2002 (F) 04/26/2002
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the date that is 10 years before May 6, 1992. To do this, we subtract 10 from 1992 to get 1982. 

Next, we need to find the date that is 10 days before May 6, 1982. To do this, we subtract 10 from 6 to get -4. However, since we cannot have a negative day, we need to borrow a month. 

We borrow a month from May, which gives us April. So, the date 10 days before May 6, 1982 is April -4, 1982. 

Since April has 30 days, we add 30 to -4 to get 26. Therefore, the date 10 days before May 6, 1982 is April 26, 1982. 

Converting this to MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(F) } 04/26/2002}$.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(F) } 04/26/2002}$.

Today is the palindrome day of 2020, because the MMDDYYYY format of the date is the same backwards as forwards. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 01/23/2011 (B) 01/23/2078 (C) 01/22/2020 (D) 03/23/2020 (E) 01/23/2020
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of today. Since today is the palindrome day of 2020, the date must be a palindrome. The only possible palindrome date in MM/DD/YYYY format is 02/02/2020.

Next, we need to find the date 10 days ago. To do this, we subtract 10 from the day, which gives us 02/02/2020 - 10 = 01/23/2020.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(E) } 01/23/2020}$.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(E) } 01/23/2020}$.

Let's think step by step.
If today is 3/5, then a month ago would be 2/5. 

Since Jane is in the year 1973, the answer must also be in the year 1973. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 02/05/1973.

Let's think step by step.
If Jane thinks today is 6/18/2019, then tomorrow would be 6/19/2019 for her. However, John thinks today is 6/19/2019, so tomorrow for him would be one day after 6/19/2019. Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }06/20/2019}$.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from today's date. 

Since today is the first day of 2007, one week ago would be December 25, 2006. 

Therefore, the answer is (E) 12/25/2006.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the date 24 hours later than June 1, 2021. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, adding 24 hours to June 1, 2021, would give us June 2, 2021. 

Therefore, the answer is (A) 06/02/2021.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date one year ago from today. Since today is a palindrome day, the date is the same backwards as forwards. Therefore, the date one year ago from today will also be a palindrome.

Next, we need to determine the format of the date one year ago. The format is MM/DD/YYYY.

Since the date is a palindrome, the month and day must be the same when read backwards. Therefore, the month and day must be either 0, 1, or 2.

Looking at the answer choices, we can eliminate options (C), (E), and (F) because they have a month or day that is not 0, 1, or 2.

Next, we need to determine the year. Since today is in 2020, the year one year ago will be 2019.

Looking at the remaining answer choices, we can eliminate options (A) and (B) because they have a year of 2019, but the month and day are not the same when read backwards.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(D) } 01/29/2019}$.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(D) } 01/29/2019}$.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the given date. 

First, let's subtract 1 year from 1966: 1966 - 1 = 1965.

Next, we need to keep track of the number of days in each month. 

In March, there are 31 days. So, if we subtract 2 days from the given date (March 2nd), we will end up in February. 

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is February 28th, 1965. 

In MM/DD/YYYY format, this is 02/28/1965. 

None of the answer choices match this date, so the correct answer is not listed.

Let's think step by step.
First, we know that today's date is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards. Since today is the palindrome day of 2020, the date must be in the format MMDDYYYY. 

Next, we need to determine what tomorrow's date will be. To do this, we need to add 1 to the current date. 

Since today is the palindrome day of 2020, the date must be in the format MMDDYYYY. 

The current date is 02022020. 

Adding 1 to the current date, we get 02022020 + 1 = 02022021. 

Converting this to MM/DD/YYYY format, we get 02/02/2021. 

However, this is not one of the answer choices. 

To find the correct answer choice, we need to determine which of the answer choices is the same forwards and backwards in the MMDDYYYY format. 

Looking at the answer choices, we see that (A) 02/03/2020 is the same forwards and backwards in the MMDDYYYY format. 

Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{\text{(A) } 02/03/2020}$.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(A) } 02/03/2020}$.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the day of the week one week ago from today. Since today is the first Monday of 2019, one week ago would be the first Monday of 2019 minus 7 days. 

To find the day of the week one week ago, we can count backwards from today. Starting with Monday, we count 7 days backwards: Monday, Sunday, Saturday, Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday. 

Therefore, one week ago from today is a Tuesday. 

Now, we need to determine the date one week ago from today. Since today is the first Monday of 2019, one week ago would be the first Monday of 2019 minus 7 days. 

To find the date one week ago, we can count backwards from today. Starting with today, we count 7 days backwards: Monday, Sunday, Saturday, Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday. 

Therefore, the date one week ago from today is 12/31/2018.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date one week ago from today. To do this, we subtract 7 days from the given date of 3/5. 

3/5 - 7 days = 2/26

So, one week ago from today is 2/26. 

Next, we need to determine the year. Since Jane is seeing a meteor shower for the second time in the year 1973, we know that the year is 1973. 

Therefore, the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY format is 02/26/1973.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current year. Since Jane was born in 2001 and she is now 16 years old, we can subtract 16 from 2001 to find the current year: 2001 - 16 = 1985.

Next, we need to determine the current month. Since Jane was born on the last day of February, her birthday is always on February 28th or 29th. Since today is her birthday, the current month is February.

Now, we need to determine the current day. Since today is Jane's birthday, the current day is the last day of February, which is either February 28th or 29th.

Finally, we need to find the date one week ago from today. Since February has 28 or 29 days, one week ago from the last day of February is either February 21st or 22nd.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many days it took for Jane to run out of eggs. Since she bought 40 eggs and ate one per day, it took her 40 days to run out of eggs.

Next, we need to find out the date one week ago from today. Since today is the day Jane ran out of eggs, we need to subtract 7 days from today's date.

Therefore, the date one week ago from today is 40 days - 7 days = 33 days ago.

To find the date, we need to subtract 33 days from today's date. However, we are not given today's date in the question, so we cannot determine the exact date one week ago.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date 176 days after March 20, 2020. 

To do this, we can start by finding the number of days in each month from March to September. 

March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June: 30 days
July: 31 days
August: 31 days
September: 30 days

Adding up these days, we get a total of 184 days. 

Since 176 days have passed since March 20, 2020, we can subtract 176 from 184 to find the number of days remaining. 

184 - 176 = 8

This means that there are 8 days remaining in September after 176 days have passed since March 20, 2020. 

Therefore, the date yesterday would be September 30, 2020. 

Converting this to MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (C) 09/30/2020.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date, 8/3/1997. 

First, let's subtract one month from the month of August. Since there are only 12 months in a year, subtracting one month from August would give us July. 

So, the month a month ago is July. 

Next, let's look at the day. Since we are subtracting one month, the day will remain the same, which is 3. 

Finally, let's look at the year. The year remains the same, which is 1997. 

Putting it all together, the date a month ago is 7/3/1997. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 07/03/1997.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(B) 07/03/1997.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from April 30, 2021. 

Starting with April 30, we subtract 1 day to get April 29. 
Then we subtract another day to get April 28. 
Continuing this pattern, we subtract 1 day 7 more times to get April 21. 

Therefore, the date 10 days ago is April 21, 2021.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many days it took for Jane to eat all 40 eggs. Since she ate one egg per day, it would take her 40 days to eat all the eggs.

Next, we need to find the date 10 days ago. To do this, we subtract 10 from the current date. Since today is May 9th, 2017, 10 days ago would be May 9th, 2017 - 10 days = May 29th, 2017.

Finally, we need to write the date in MM/DD/YYYY format. May 29th, 2017 would be written as 05/29/2017.

Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 05/15/2017.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from December 31, 1899. 

Starting with December 31, 1899, if we subtract 1 day, we get December 30, 1899. 
If we subtract another day, we get December 29, 1899. 
Continuing this pattern, if we subtract 10 days, we will end up on December 21, 1899. 

Therefore, the date 10 days ago is 12/21/1899.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the date 10 days ago from July 29, 2002. To do this, we subtract 10 from the day, which gives us 29 - 10 = 19.

Next, we need to determine the month and year. Since we are going back 10 days from July 29, we need to check if we need to go back to the previous month or year.

In this case, we do not need to go back to the previous month because July has 31 days, and 19 is still within the month of July.

Therefore, the date 10 days ago from July 29, 2002, is July 19, 2002.

Converting this to MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (F) 07/18/2002.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current year. Since Jane was born in 2001 and today is her 16th birthday, we can subtract 16 from 2001 to find the current year: 2001 - 16 = 1985.

Next, we need to determine the current month. Since Jane was born on the last day of February, her birthday will always fall on the last day of February. Therefore, the current month is February.

Now, we need to determine the current day. Since today is Jane's 16th birthday, we can subtract 16 from the last day of February to find the current day: 28 - 16 = 12.

Finally, we can put all the information together to find the date 10 days ago. Since today is February 28, 1985, we can subtract 10 days to find the date 10 days ago: February 28, 1985 - 10 days = February 18, 1985.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 02/18/1985.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the given deadline date of June 1, 2021.

Starting with June 1, 2021, we subtract 10 days:
June 1, 2021 - 10 days = May 22, 2021

Therefore, the date 10 days ago from the given deadline is May 22, 2021.

In MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (A) 05/22/2021.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the given date. 

First, let's subtract 1 year from 2004: 2004 - 1 = 2003.

Next, let's subtract 1 from the month, which is May (the 5th month): 5 - 1 = 4.

Therefore, the month one year ago from today is April.

Finally, the date one year ago from today is 5/4/2003.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many days it has been since May 9th, 2017. Today is June 18th, 2017, so we count the number of days between these two dates.

May 9th to May 31st = 22 days
June 1st to June 18th = 18 days

So, it has been a total of 22 + 18 = 40 days since May 9th, 2017.

Since Jane ate one egg per day, and she bought 40 eggs, it means that she has eaten all the eggs in 40 days.

Therefore, today is the last day she has an egg, and tomorrow she will run out of eggs.

So, tomorrow's date will be June 19th, 2017.

The correct answer is (C) 06/19/2017.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the date that is 5 years after Jan 2, 1958. To do this, we add 5 years to the year, which gives us Jan 2, 1963.

Next, we need to find the date that is a month before Jan 2, 1963. To do this, we subtract 1 month from the month, which gives us Dec 2, 1962.

Therefore, the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 12/02/1962.

Let's think step by step.
Since the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, we can determine that the first Monday of 2019 is 6 days after the first day of 2019. Therefore, today is 6 days after the first day of 2019.

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from today. Since today is 6 days after the first day of 2019, 10 days ago would be 6 days before the first day of 2019.

To find the date 6 days before the first day of 2019, we subtract 6 days from the first day of 2019. This gives us December 26, 2018.

Therefore, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 12/26/2018.

The correct answer is (A) 12/24/2018.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date a month ago from September 1st, 2021, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

September has 30 days, so if we subtract one month from September 1st, we will end up in August. 

Therefore, the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 08/01/2021.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date 3 days later than April 10, 1985. To do this, we add 3 days to April 10, 1985.

April has 30 days, so April 10 + 3 days = April 13.

Therefore, the date 3 days later than April 10, 1985 is April 13, 1985.

Let's think step by step.
Jane got her job in 2016, so her work anniversary would be in 2019. Today is her 3-year work anniversary, so the current year is 2019.

To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current year. So, the year would be 2018.

Let's think step by step.
The first quarter of 2008 consists of the months January, February, and March. Since today is the last day of the first quarter, it means today's date is March 31, 2008.

To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from March 31, 2008. 

Since February has 28 days in a non-leap year, the date a month ago would be February 28, 2008.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many days Jane had eggs for. She bought 40 eggs on May 9th, 2017, and ate one per day. So, she had eggs for 40 days.

Next, we need to find out how many days are in a year. Since we are looking for the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 365 days from today's date.

Now, we can subtract the number of days Jane had eggs for from the number of days in a year. 365 - 40 = 325.

Finally, we need to find out the date that is 325 days before today's date. We can do this by subtracting 325 days from today's date.

Therefore, the answer is the date that is 325 days before today's date in MM/DD/YYYY format.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of the palindrome day in MM/DD/YYYY format. Since the date is the same backwards as forwards, the month and day must be the same. The only possible options for the month and day are 02/02, 03/03, 04/04, 05/05, 06/06, 07/07, 08/08, 09/09, 10/10, 11/11, and 12/12. However, since the date is in 2020, the only possible option is 02/02/2020.

Next, we need to determine the date one day before 02/02/2020. To do this, we subtract 1 from the day, resulting in 02/01/2020.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(A) } 02/01/2020}$.

Let's think step by step.
Jane got her job in 2016, so her work anniversary would be in 2019. Since today is her 3-year work anniversary, we can subtract 3 years from the current year to find the year of her work anniversary. 

Current year - 3 years = 2019

Now, we know that on her second day at work, which was December 2, she spilled coffee on her laptop. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from December 2, 2019.

December 2, 2019 - 10 days = November 22, 2019

Therefore, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 11/22/2019. 

The correct answer is (C) 11/22/2019.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current date. Since 2015 is coming in 36 hours, we subtract 36 hours from the current time. 

Next, we need to determine the date 24 hours later. We add 24 hours to the current date. 

Finally, we write the date in MM/DD/YYYY format. 

Since we don't know the current date, we cannot determine the date 24 hours later. Therefore, the answer is (F) 12/30/2014.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current year. Since Jane was born in 2000 and is now 16 years old, we can subtract 16 from 2000 to find the current year: 2000 - 16 = 1984.

Next, we need to determine the current month. Since Jane was born on the last day of February, her birthday is always on February 28th. Therefore, the current month is February.

Now, we can determine the current day. Since today is Jane's 16th birthday, we can subtract 16 from 28 to find the current day: 28 - 16 = 12.

Finally, we can subtract 10 days from the current day to find the date 10 days ago: 12 - 10 = 2.

Putting it all together, the date 10 days ago is February 2nd, 1984.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 02/19/1979.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the current date. Since 2015 is coming in 36 hours, we can assume that the current date is December 31, 2014. 

Subtracting 10 days from December 31, 2014, we get December 21, 2014. 

Therefore, the date 10 days ago is 12/21/2014.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date that is 3 days after April 10, 1985. To do this, we add 3 days to April 10, 1985.

April has 30 days, so April 10 + 3 days = April 13.

Next, we need to determine the date that is one week after April 13, 1985. To do this, we add 7 days to April 13.

April has 30 days, so April 13 + 7 days = April 20.

Therefore, the date one week from today is April 20, 1985.

Let's think step by step.
The day before yesterday was 11/23/1933. To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from 11/23/1933. 

To do this, we can subtract 1 from the day, which gives us 11/22/1933. 

Therefore, the date yesterday is 11/22/1933.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of their golden wedding anniversary. A golden wedding anniversary is celebrated after 50 years of marriage. Since they married on Jan 2, 1958, their golden wedding anniversary would be on Jan 2, 2008.

Next, we need to find the date 10 days before Jan 2, 2008. To do this, we subtract 10 days from Jan 2, 2008. 

Jan 2, 2008 - 10 days = Dec 23, 2007

Therefore, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 12/23/2007.

The correct answer is (D) 12/23/2007.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Jane's current visit to the bookstore. Since she visits on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009, we can count the number of months that have passed since October 2009 to find the current month.

Since October 2009, there have been 12 months in 2009, 12 months in 2010, and 1 month in 2011 (January). Therefore, a total of 25 months have passed.

Since Jane is on her 5th visit to the bookstore, we can subtract 5 months from the current month to find the month of her first visit. 25 - 5 = 20.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can subtract 12 from 20 to find the month of her first visit in the current year. 20 - 12 = 8.

Therefore, Jane's first visit to the bookstore in the current year was in August.

Now, we need to find the date one week from today. Since today is the 16th, one week from today would be the 23rd.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 02/23/2010.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(A) 02/23/2010.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date one week from today. To do this, we add 7 days to the current date, which is 10/16/1924.

10/16/1924 + 7 days = 10/23/1924

Now, we need to convert this date to MM/DD/YYYY format. The answer is (B) 10/22/1924.

On May 9th, 2017 Jane bought 40 eggs. She ate one per day. Today she ran out of eggs. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 06/25/2063 (B) 06/25/2017 (C) 05/25/2018 (D) 06/25/1964 (E) 07/25/2017 (F) 06/24/2017
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many days it has been since May 9th, 2017. Today is one week from today, so we subtract 7 days from the current date. 

Next, we need to subtract the number of days Jane has been eating eggs. Since she bought 40 eggs and ate one per day, she has been eating eggs for 40 days. 

So, the total number of days since May 9th, 2017 is 7 + 40 = 47 days. 

Now, we need to find out what the date is 47 days after May 9th, 2017. 

To do this, we can start by finding out what the date is 30 days after May 9th, 2017. 

May has 31 days, so if we subtract 30 days from May 9th, we get April 9th. 

Now, we have 17 more days to add to April 9th. 

April has 30 days, so if we add 17 days to April 9th, we get April 26th. 

Therefore, the date 47 days after May 9th, 2017 is April 26th. 

Now, we need to find out what the date is one week from today. 

If today is April 26th, then one week from today is May 3rd. 

Therefore, the answer is (F) 06/24/2017.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(F) 06/24/2017.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago from 8/3/1997, we subtract 10 from the day, which gives us 8/3/1997 - 10 = 7/24/1997.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 07/24/1997.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of their golden wedding anniversary. A golden wedding anniversary is celebrated after 50 years of marriage. Since they married on Jan 2, 1958, their golden wedding anniversary would be on Jan 2, 2008.

Next, we need to find the date one week ago from today. To do this, we subtract 7 days from Jan 2, 2008. 

Jan 2, 2008 - 7 days = Dec 26, 2007

Therefore, the date one week ago from today is Dec 26, 2007.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of the meteor shower. Since it is Jane's second time seeing the meteor shower in 1973, we can assume that the meteor shower occurs on the same date each year. Therefore, the date of the meteor shower is 3/5.

Next, we need to determine the date tomorrow. Since today is 3/5, tomorrow would be 3/6.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 03/06/1973.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date, which is 10/16/1924.

First, let's subtract 1 day from 10/16/1924: 10/15/1924.
Next, let's subtract 1 more day: 10/14/1924.
Continuing this process, we subtract 1 day 10 times: 10/13/1924, 10/12/1924, 10/11/1924, 10/10/1924, 10/09/1924, 10/08/1924, 10/07/1924, 10/06/1924, 10/05/1924.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the date 176 days after March 20, 2020. To do this, we can add 176 days to March 20, 2020.

March has 31 days, so we can subtract 31 from 176 to get 145 days remaining.
April has 30 days, so we can subtract 30 from 145 to get 115 days remaining.
May has 31 days, so we can subtract 31 from 115 to get 84 days remaining.
June has 30 days, so we can subtract 30 from 84 to get 54 days remaining.
July has 31 days, so we can subtract 31 from 54 to get 23 days remaining.
August has 31 days, so we can subtract 31 from 23 to get -8 days remaining.

Since we have a negative number of days remaining, we need to go back to the previous month, which is July. We can add the remaining 23 days to July 31, 2020.

July 31 + 23 = August 23, 2020.

Now, we need to find the date one week from August 23, 2020. To do this, we can add 7 days to August 23, 2020.

August 23 + 7 = August 30, 2020.

Therefore, the date one week from today is August 30, 2020, which is represented as 08/30/2020.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the number of months that have passed since October 2009. Since Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, we can count the number of visits she has made. Since today is her 5th visit, we can subtract 5 from the current month to find the month of her first visit. 

Since today is the 16th of a certain month, we can subtract 5 from the current month to find the month of her first visit. 

If today is October, then her first visit was in June. 
If today is November, then her first visit was in July. 
If today is December, then her first visit was in August. 
If today is January, then her first visit was in September. 
If today is February, then her first visit was in October. 

Since today is February, her first visit was in October. 

Next, we need to determine the year of her first visit. Since she started visiting in October 2009, her first visit was in October 2009. 

Now, we can determine the date yesterday. Since today is the 16th, yesterday would be the 15th. 

Therefore, the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format is 02/15/2010. 

The correct answer is (A) 02/15/2010.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date. 

Since 2015 is coming in 36 hours, we can assume that today's date is December 31st, 2014. 

Subtracting 1 year from December 31st, 2014, we get December 31st, 2013. 

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 12/31/2013. 

However, none of the answer choices match this date. 

The closest option is (F) 12/28/2013, which is 3 days before the actual date.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many days it has been since May 9th, 2017. Today is July 13th, 2017, so we count the number of days between these two dates.

May 9th to May 31st: 31 - 9 = 22 days
June 1st to June 30th: 30 days
July 1st to July 13th: 13 days

Total days = 22 + 30 + 13 = 65 days

Since Jane ate one egg per day, we subtract 65 from the initial 40 eggs she bought.

40 - 65 = -25

Since we can't have a negative number of eggs, it means that Jane ran out of eggs before today. Therefore, the date yesterday was July 12th, 2017.

The answer is (D) 07/12/2017.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the number of days in September 1909. Since September is the 9th month, we know that it has 30 days.

Next, we need to add 24 hours to the current date of September 9, 1909. Since there are 24 hours in a day, adding 24 hours is equivalent to adding 1 day.

Therefore, the date 24 hours later is September 10, 1909.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of the concert. The concert was originally scheduled for 06/01/1943. However, it was delayed by one day, so the concert took place on 06/02/1943.

Next, we need to find the date that was 10 days ago from the concert date. To do this, we subtract 10 days from 06/02/1943.

06/02/1943 - 10 days = 05/23/1943

Therefore, the date that was 10 days ago from the concert date is 05/23/1943.

The correct answer is (D) 05/23/1943.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

Since the given date is September 9, 1909, subtracting one month would give us August 9, 1909. 

Therefore, the answer is (D) 08/09/1909.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the date that is 10 years after May 6, 1992. To do this, we add 10 to the year: $1992+10=2002$. So, the date 10 years later is May 6, 2002.

Next, we need to find the date 24 hours later. Since there are 24 hours in a day, adding 24 hours to May 6, 2002 will give us May 7, 2002.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(E) } 05/07/2002}$.

Let's think step by step.
First, let's find the date two days ago. Since the day before yesterday was 11/23/1933, two days ago would be 11/21/1933.

Next, let's find the date a month ago. Since November has 30 days, a month ago from 11/21/1933 would be 10/21/1933.

Let's think step by step.
Since the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, we can determine that the first Monday of 2019 is January 7, 2019. 

To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from January 7, 2019. 

So, the date one year ago from today is January 7, 2018.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from today's date. 

Today's date is 12/31/1929. 

Subtracting 1 year from 1929 gives us 1928. 

So, the date one year ago from today is 12/31/1928. 

However, this date is not one of the answer choices. 

To find the correct answer, we need to look for a date that is closest to 12/31/1928.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Jane's current visit to the bookstore. Since she visits on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009, we can count the number of months that have passed since October 2009 to find the current month.

Since it is her 5th visit, we can subtract 5 from the current month to find the month of her first visit. 

If we subtract 5 from the current month, we get:

Current month - 5 = First visit month

Since we know that her first visit was in October 2009, we can determine the current month.

Let's say the current month is X.

X - 5 = 10

Solving for X, we find that the current month is 15.

Now, we need to determine the date a month ago. Since we know that the current month is 15, we can subtract 1 from the current month to find the previous month.

15 - 1 = 14

Since the previous month is 14, we can determine the date a month ago.

The date a month ago is 14/16/YYYY.

However, since we are looking for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to convert the date to the correct format.

The date a month ago is 01/16/YYYY.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 01/16/2010.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(B) 01/16/2010.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the number of months that have passed since October 2009. Since Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, we can count the number of visits she has made. Since today is her 5th visit, this means that 4 months have passed since October 2009.

Next, we need to determine the current month. Since October is the starting month and 4 months have passed, we can count forward from October to find the current month. October, November, December, January, February. Therefore, the current month is February.

Finally, we need to determine the current year. Since October 2009 is the starting year and 4 months have passed, we can count forward from 2009 to find the current year. 2009, 2010. Therefore, the current year is 2010.

Putting it all together, the date tomorrow will be 02/17/2010. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(A) } 02/17/2010}$.

First, we need to determine the date of the meteor shower. Since it is Jane's second time seeing the meteor shower in the year 1973, we can assume that the meteor shower occurs on the same date each year. 

Since today is 3/5, we can conclude that the meteor shower occurs on 3/5 each year. 

Next, we need to determine the date yesterday. Since today is 3/5, yesterday would be 3/4.

March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September has 13 days (since we are only counting up to tomorrow). 

Adding up these days, we get a total of 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 13 = 197 days. 

Since we are looking for the date 176 days after March 20, 2020, we need to subtract 197 - 176 = 21 days from September 13, 2020. 

Therefore, the date tomorrow is September 13, 2020 - 21 days = August 23, 2020.

May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to Jane, but that is actually ten years ago. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 11/13/2001 (B) 03/13/2003 (C) 05/13/2044 (D) 06/10/2002 (E) 05/13/2002
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date that is ten years after May 6, 1992. To do this, we add 10 years to the year 1992, which gives us 2002. So, the date ten years after May 6, 1992 is May 6, 2002.

Next, we need to find the date one week from May 6, 2002. To do this, we add 7 days to May 6, 2002. This gives us May 13, 2002.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 05/13/2002.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the month and day of tomorrow's date. Since tomorrow is 11/12/2019, the month is 11 and the day is 12.

Next, we need to determine the year of tomorrow's date. Since the given date is already in 2019, the year remains the same.

Putting it all together, tomorrow's date in MM/DD/YYYY format is 11/13/2019.

Jane got her job in 2016. Today is her 3-year work anniversary. She still remember that on Dec 2, her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 10/06/2019 (B) 12/02/2019 (C) 12/03/2019 (D) 12/01/2019 (E) 12/01/2101
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the year of Jane's work anniversary. Since she got her job in 2016 and it is her 3-year work anniversary, we can add 3 years to 2016 to find the current year. 

2016 + 3 = 2019

So, the current year is 2019. 

Next, we need to determine the month and day of Jane's work anniversary. Since she spilled coffee on her laptop on her second day at work, we can count 2 days from December 2nd to find her work anniversary. 

December 2nd + 2 days = December 4th

Therefore, Jane's work anniversary is on December 4th. 

Finally, we can write the date in MM/DD/YYYY format. 

The date today is 12/04/2019. 

Therefore, the correct answer is not listed among the answer choices.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from January 1, 2007. 

Starting with January 1, 2007, we subtract 1 day to get December 31, 2006. 
Then, we subtract 9 more days to get December 22, 2006. 

Therefore, the date 10 days ago is December 22, 2006.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of the meteor shower. Since it is Jane's second time seeing the meteor shower in 1973, we can assume that the first time she saw it was earlier in the year. 

Since today is 3/5, we can assume that the meteor shower occurred before today's date. Let's assume it occurred on 3/4. 

Next, we need to find the date 10 days ago from 3/4. 

To do this, we subtract 10 days from 3/4. 

3/4 - 10 days = 2/22

Therefore, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 02/22/1973. 

However, this date is not one of the answer choices. 

Let's try another approach. 

If today is Jane's second time seeing the meteor shower in 1973, we can assume that the first time she saw it was earlier in the year. 

Since today is 3/5, we can assume that the meteor shower occurred before today's date. Let's assume it occurred on 3/4. 

Next, we need to find the date 10 days ago from 3/4. 

To do this, we subtract 10 days from 3/4. 

3/4 - 10 days = 2/22

Therefore, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 02/22/1973. 

However, this date is not one of the answer choices. 

Let's try another approach. 

If today is Jane's second time seeing the meteor shower in 1973, we can assume that the first time she saw it was earlier in the year.

First, we need to determine the number of years that have passed since Jan 2, 1958, to today's date. 

Today is their golden wedding anniversary, which means it has been 50 years since they got married. 

To find the date tomorrow, we simply add one day to today's date.

Let's think step by step.
Jane got her job in 2016, so her work anniversary would be in 2019. Since today is her 3-year work anniversary, we can subtract 3 years from the current year to find the year of her job start date: 2019 - 3 = 2016.

On her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop, which happened on Dec 2. To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract 1 day from Dec 2. 

Therefore, the date yesterday would be Dec 1.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date today in MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to look at the given date and determine the number of days that have passed since then.

First, let's calculate the number of days between 4/19/1969 and today's date, 4/19/1969.

Since it is the same day, the number of days that have passed is 0.

Therefore, the date today in MM/DD/YYYY format is 04/19/1969.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago from September 1st, 2021, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date. 

Starting with September 1st, we subtract 1 day to get to August 31st. Then, we subtract another 9 days to get to August 22nd.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract 1 day from the current date. Since 2015 is coming in 36 hours, we can subtract 1 day from the current date by subtracting 24 hours. 

So, the date yesterday would be 36 hours - 24 hours = 12 hours before the start of 2015. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, 12 hours before the start of 2015 would be on December 31, 2014. 

Therefore, the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format is 12/31/2014.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of the last day of the first quarter of 2008. The first quarter of the year consists of January, February, and March. Therefore, the last day of the first quarter of 2008 is March 31, 2008.

Next, we need to find the date one week from March 31, 2008. To do this, we add 7 days to March 31, 2008. 

March 31 + 7 days = April 7, 2008

On May 9th, 2017 Jane bought 40 eggs. She ate one per day. Today she ran out of eggs. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 06/18/2054 (B) 06/18/2016 (C) 06/18/2017 (D) 07/16/2017 (E) 12/18/2016 (F) 06/17/2017
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many days it has been since May 9th, 2017. Today is June 18th, 2017, so we need to count the number of days between these two dates.

May has 31 days, so there are 31 - 9 = 22 days left in May after May 9th.
June has 30 days, so there are 30 days in June.

Adding these two numbers together, we get 22 + 30 = 52 days.

Since Jane ate one egg per day, this means she has eaten 52 eggs.

Since she started with 40 eggs, this means she has eaten 40 + 52 = 92 eggs in total.

Since she ran out of eggs today, this means today is the 92nd day since May 9th, 2017.

To find the date today in MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to count forward 92 days from May 9th, 2017.

Starting from May 9th, we count forward:

May 10th, May 11th, May 12th, ... , June 7th, June 8th, June 9th, ... , June 17th, June 18th.

So the date today is 06/18/2017.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 06/18/2017.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine what day of the week July 9, 1972 falls on. We can use a calendar or an online tool to find this information. 

July 9, 1972, falls on a Sunday. 

Next, we need to determine what day of the week tomorrow (July 9, 1972) will be. Since tomorrow is Tuesday, we need to add 2 days to the current day (Sunday) to get the new day (Tuesday). 

Now, we can determine the date tomorrow (July 9, 1972) in MM/DD/YYYY format. 

The answer is (C) 07/09/1972.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Jane's birthday. Since she was born on the last day of February in 2000, her birthday is on February 29th. 

Next, we need to determine the current year. Since today is her 16th birthday, we subtract 16 from 2000 to find that the current year is 1984. 

Now, we need to determine the date one week from today. Since February 29th only occurs during leap years, we need to determine if the current year is a leap year. 

To determine if a year is a leap year, we use the following rules:
- If the year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
- However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless it is also divisible by 400.

Since 1984 is divisible by 4, it is a leap year. 

Now, we can determine the date one week from today. Since February has 29 days in a leap year, we add 7 days to February 29th to get March 7th. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(E) } 03/07/2016}$.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(E) } 03/07/2016}$.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Jane's current visit to the bookstore. Since she visits on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009, we can count the number of months that have passed since October 2009 to find the current month.

Since it is her 5th visit, we can subtract 5 from the current month to find the month of her first visit. 

Let's start counting:

October 2009 - 1st visit
November 2009 - 2nd visit
December 2009 - 3rd visit
January 2010 - 4th visit
February 2010 - 5th visit

So, Jane's current visit is in February 2010.

Now, we need to find the date one week ago from today. To do this, we subtract 7 days from the current date.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract 1 day from the given date of 7/9/1972. 

To do this, we can start by subtracting 1 from the day, which gives us 7/8/1972. 

However, since this is still in the same month, we need to keep subtracting days until we reach the previous month. 

Continuing to subtract 1 day at a time, we get:

7/8/1972 -> 7/7/1972 -> 7/6/1972 -> 7/5/1972 -> 7/4/1972 -> 7/3/1972 -> 7/2/1972 -> 7/1/1972

Therefore, the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format is 07/01/1972.

First, we need to determine the date of their 5-year anniversary. To do this, we add 5 years to the original date of their marriage: Jan 2, 1958 + 5 years = Jan 2, 1963.

Next, we need to determine the current date. Since the question states that it is their 5-year anniversary "today," we can assume that the current date is Jan 2, 1963.

Finally, we need to write the current date in MM/DD/YYYY format. Therefore, the answer is (D) 01/02/1961.

First, let's subtract one month from the month of October. Since there are only 12 months in a year, subtracting one month from October would give us September. 

Next, let's subtract one year from the year 1924. Since we are going back in time, we need to subtract one year from 1924, which gives us 1923. 

Therefore, the date a month ago would be 09/16/1923. 

However, this date is not one of the answer choices. 

Let's try another approach. 

Instead of subtracting one month from the given date, let's subtract one month from the rescheduled meeting date of 10/16/1924. 

Subtracting one month from October gives us September. 

Therefore, the date a month ago would be 09/16/1924. 

Again, this date is not one of the answer choices. 

Let's try one more approach. 

Instead of subtracting one month from the given date, let's subtract one month from the rescheduled meeting date of 10/16/1924. 

Subtracting one month from October gives us September. 

However, September only has 30 days, so the date a month ago would be 09/30/1924. 

This date is also not one of the answer choices. 

Therefore, none of the given answer choices match the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer isNone of the above.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current date. Since the deadline is 2 days away from now, we subtract 2 days from June 1, 2021. 

June 1, 2021 - 2 days = May 30, 2021

Next, we need to find the date one week from today. We add 7 days to May 30, 2021. 

May 30, 2021 + 7 days = June 6, 2021

Therefore, the date one week from today is June 6, 2021. 

The answer is (B) 06/06/2021.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of their golden wedding anniversary. A golden wedding anniversary is celebrated after 50 years of marriage. Since they married on Jan 2, 1958, their golden wedding anniversary would be on Jan 2, 2008.

Next, we need to find the date 24 hours later. Adding 24 hours to Jan 2, 2008, we get Jan 3, 2008.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 01/03/2008.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the given date of 5/4/2004. 

First, let's determine the number of days in each month:

January: 31 days
February: 28 days (or 29 in a leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days

Since the given date is in May, we know that the previous month was April, which has 30 days.

Next, we subtract one day from the given date:

5/4/2004 - 1 day = 5/3/2004

Therefore, the date yesterday is 5/3/2004.

The correct answer choice is (E) 05/03/2004.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one week from today, we need to add 7 days to the current date. 

Since it is the last day of 1899, the current date is 12/31/1899. 

Adding 7 days to 12/31/1899, we get 01/07/1900. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 01/07/1900.

Let's think step by step.
Since the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, we know that the first Monday of 2019 is January 7th. 

To find the date 24 hours later, we simply add 1 day to January 7th. 

Therefore, the date 24 hours later is January 8th. 

So the answer is $\boxed{\text{(A) } 01/08/2019}$.

Let's think step by step.
Jane got her job in 2016, so her work anniversary would be in 2019. Since today is her 3-year work anniversary, we can subtract 3 years from the current year to find the year of her job start date: 2019 - 3 = 2016.

On her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop, which happened on Dec 2. To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date.

Since today is the 3-year work anniversary, we can assume that today's date is Dec 2, 2019. Subtracting 7 days from Dec 2, 2019, we get Nov 25, 2019.

Therefore, the date one week ago from today is 11/25/2019.

The correct answer is (E) 11/24/2019.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(E) 11/24/2019.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from 11/12/2019. 

Starting with the day, 12 minus 10 is 2. So the day is 2. 

Next, we look at the month. November has 30 days, so 11 minus 10 is 1. So the month is 1. 

Finally, the year remains the same, so it is 2019.

Yesterday was 12/31/1929. Today could not be 12/32/1929 because December has only 31 days. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 09/22/1929 (B) 10/31/1929 (C) 12/22/1973 (D) 11/19/1929 (E) 12/22/1929
Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date of 12/31/1929.

Starting with the day, we subtract 10 from 31, which gives us 21. So the day 10 days ago is the 21st.

Next, we look at the month. Since we are still in December, the month remains the same.

Finally, we look at the year. Since we are still in 1929, the year remains the same.

Putting it all together, the date 10 days ago is 12/21/1929.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 12/21/1929.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(E) 12/21/1929.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Thanksgiving in 2001. Since Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November, we can count back from the last day of November in 2001. The last day of November in 2001 is November 30th. 

Counting back four Thursdays from November 30th, we get November 29th, November 22nd, November 15th, and November 8th. 

Therefore, one week ago from Thanksgiving 2001 is November 8th, 2001. 

Converting this to MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (F) 11/08/2001.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(F) 11/08/2001

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 1 day to the given date. 

Since April has 30 days, adding 1 day to April 19th will give us April 20th.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date 10 days ago from 9/7. To do this, we subtract 10 from the day of the month: 7 - 10 = -3.

Since we cannot have a negative day of the month, we need to borrow from the month. We subtract 1 from the month and add the number of days in the previous month. In this case, the previous month is August, which has 31 days.

So, we have 31 - 3 = 28.

Therefore, the date 10 days ago from 9/7 is 8/28.

The correct answer is (C) 08/28/2003.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(C) 08/28/2003.

Let's think step by step.
One week ago from today would be the same day of the week, but one week earlier. Since today is the last day of the first quarter of 2008, one week ago would still be in the first quarter of 2008. 

The first quarter of 2008 spans from January 1, 2008, to March 31, 2008. 

To find the date one week ago, we subtract 7 days from March 31, 2008. 

March 31, 2008 - 7 days = March 24, 2008. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(A) } 03/24/2008}$.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(A) } 03/24/2008}$.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Jane's birthday this year. Since she was born on the last day of February, her birthday will always be on February 28th, except during leap years when it will be on February 29th. Since the year 2000 was a leap year, Jane's birthday this year will be on February 29th.

Next, we need to determine the date one year ago from today. Since today is Jane's 16th birthday, we need to go back 16 years. However, since we are looking for the date one year ago from today, we only need to go back 15 years.

To find the date one year ago from today, we can subtract 15 years from the current year and keep the same month and day. Since today is February 29th, we can subtract 15 years from 2000 to get 1985. Therefore, the date one year ago from today is February 29, 1985.

However, since 1985 was not a leap year, February 29th does not exist. Therefore, we need to go back to the last day of February, which is February 28th. Therefore, the date one year ago from today is February 28, 1985.

Converting this date to MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (B) 02/28/1985.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(B) 02/28/2015.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract 1 from the day. 

Since today is 4/19/1969, yesterday would be 4/18/1969. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 04/18/1969.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current year. Since Jane was born in 2000 and is now 16 years old, we can subtract 16 from 2000 to find the current year: 2000 - 16 = 1984.

Next, we need to determine the current month. Since Jane was born on the last day of February, her birthday is on February 29th. However, February only has 29 days during leap years, which occur every 4 years. Since 2000 was a leap year, we can assume that Jane's birthday is on February 29th. Therefore, the current month is February.

Now, we can determine the current day. Since today is Jane's 16th birthday, we can subtract 16 from 29 to find the current day: 29 - 16 = 13.

Therefore, the current date is February 13, 1984.

Finally, we need to determine the date a month ago. Since February has 28 days during non-leap years, we can subtract 28 from the current day to find the date a month ago: 13 - 28 = -15.

Since we have a negative number, we need to borrow a day from the previous month. Therefore, the date a month ago is January 31, 1984.

Converting this to MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (E) 01/31/1984.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(E) 01/31/1984.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one week ago from 4/19/1969, we need to subtract 7 days from that date. 

Starting with the month, April has 30 days. Subtracting 7 from 19 gives us 12. 

So, the month is still April. 

Next, we subtract 7 from the day, which gives us 5. 

Therefore, the date one week ago from 4/19/1969 is 4/12/1969. 

The correct answer is (C) 04/12/1969.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Jane's birthday this year. Since she was born on the last day of February, her birthday will always be on February 28th, except during leap years when it will be on February 29th. 

Next, we need to determine if this year is a leap year. A leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. Since 2000 is divisible by 400, it is a leap year. Therefore, Jane's birthday this year will be on February 29th.

Now, we need to determine the date yesterday. Since today is Jane's 16th birthday, yesterday would be the day before her birthday. Therefore, the date yesterday would be February 28th.

So the answer is (B) 02/28/2016.

2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 12/29/2014 (B) 12/30/1933 (C) 01/30/2014 (D) 10/30/2015 (E) 12/31/2014 (F) 12/30/2014
Let's think step by step.
To find the date tomorrow, we need to add 1 day to the current date. Since it is currently 36 hours until 2015, we can subtract 36 hours from the current time to find the current date.

There are 24 hours in a day, so 36 hours is equal to 1 day and 12 hours.

If we subtract 1 day and 12 hours from the current time, we will get the current date.

Now, let's look at the answer choices:

(A) 12/29/2014 - This is the date before the current date, so it is not the correct answer.
(B) 12/30/1933 - This is not the current date or the date tomorrow, so it is not the correct answer.
(C) 01/30/2014 - This is not the current date or the date tomorrow, so it is not the correct answer.
(D) 10/30/2015 - This is not the current date or the date tomorrow, so it is not the correct answer.
(E) 12/31/2014 - This is the current date, so it is not the correct answer.
(F) 12/30/2014 - This is the date before the current date, so it is not the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 12/31/2014.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the number of days between September 9, 1909, and September 9, 1909. Since it is the same day, the number of days is 0.

Next, we need to add this number of days to September 9, 1909. Adding 0 days to a date does not change the date.

Therefore, the date today is still September 9, 1909.

The answer is (C) 09/09/1909.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(C) 09/09/1909.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

Starting with 5/4/2004, subtracting one month would give us 4/4/2004. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 04/04/2004.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of their golden wedding anniversary. A golden wedding anniversary is celebrated after 50 years of marriage. Since they married on Jan 2, 1958, their golden wedding anniversary would be on Jan 2, 2008.

Next, we need to find the date a month ago from their golden wedding anniversary. To do this, we subtract one month from Jan 2, 2008. 

Since the previous month is December, the date a month ago would be Dec 2, 2007.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 12/02/2007.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of today. Since today is the palindrome day of 2020, the date is 02/02/2020.

Next, we need to find the date one week from today. To do this, we add 7 days to the current date.

Let's think step by step.
The concert was originally scheduled for 06/01/1943. 
It was delayed by one day, so the concert took place on 06/02/1943. 
To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from 06/02/1943. 
Therefore, the date yesterday is 06/01/1943.

Let's think step by step.
First, we know that Jane thought today is 3/11/2002, but it is actually Mar 12, which is 1 day later. So, we need to add 1 day to 3/11/2002.

To do this, we can start by adding 1 day to the day part of the date. Since 3/11/2002 is in the format MM/DD/YYYY, we add 1 to 11 to get 12.

Next, we need to check if the resulting date is valid. In this case, Mar 12 is a valid date.

Finally, we put the resulting date in the format MM/DD/YYYY, which is 03/12/2002.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(D) } 03/12/2002}$.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(D) } 03/12/2002}$.

Let's think step by step.
First, we know that Jane thinks today is 6/18/2019. Since John is correct, we can eliminate answer choices (A), (B), (D), and (E) because they all have a different date than what John thinks.

Now, we are left with answer choices (C) and (F). Since John thinks today is 6/19/2019, the correct answer must be (C) 06/19/2019.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Jane's birthday in 2017. Since she was born on the last day of February, her birthday will always fall on February 28th, except in leap years when it will be on February 29th.

Next, we need to determine if 2017 is a leap year. To determine this, we need to check if the year is divisible by 4. Since 2017 is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year.

Therefore, Jane's birthday in 2017 will be on February 28th.

Now, we need to determine the current date. Since Jane is celebrating her 16th birthday, we need to add 16 years to her birth year of 2001. This gives us the year 2017.

Therefore, the date today is February 28, 2017.

The answer is (C) 02/28/2017.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the date that is 3 days after April 10, 1985. To do this, we add 3 days to April 10, 1985.

April 10 + 3 days = April 13

So, Jane's appointment will be on April 13, 1985.

Next, we need to find the date that is 10 days before April 13, 1985. To do this, we subtract 10 days from April 13, 1985.

April 13 - 10 days = April 3

So, the date that is 10 days ago is April 3, 1985.

Finally, we need to write the date in MM/DD/YYYY format. The date April 3, 1985, is written as 04/03/1985.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 03/31/1985.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current year. Since May 6, 1992, was ten years ago, we subtract 10 from 1992 to get 1982. 

Next, we need to determine the current month. Since May 6, 1992, was ten years ago, we subtract 10 from 5 to get -5. However, since we cannot have a negative month, we add 12 to -5 to get 7. Therefore, the current month is July.

Now, we need to determine the current day. Since May 6, 1992, was ten years ago, we subtract 10 from 6 to get -4. However, since we cannot have a negative day, we add 31 to -4 to get 27. Therefore, the current day is July 27.

Finally, we need to determine the date a month ago. Since the current month is July, a month ago would be June. Therefore, the date a month ago is 06/27/1982.

Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2000. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 02/22/2016 (B) 11/22/2016 (C) 04/22/2015 (D) 02/23/2016 (E) 06/22/2015 (F) 04/22/2016
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current year. Since Jane was born in 2000 and is now 16 years old, we can subtract 16 from 2000 to find the current year: 2000 - 16 = 1984.

Next, we need to determine the current month. Since Jane was born on the last day of February, her birthday is always on February 28th. Therefore, the current month is February.

Now, we need to determine the current day. Since today is Jane's 16th birthday, we can subtract 16 from 28 to find the current day: 28 - 16 = 12.

So, the current date is 02/12/1984.

Finally, we need to find the date one week ago from today. To do this, we subtract 7 days from the current date: 02/12/1984 - 7 days = 02/05/1984.

Therefore, the answer is 02/05/1984.

However, none of the answer choices match this date. Therefore, there may be an error in the question or answer choices.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer isnone of the above.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract 1 from the given date, which is January 21, 2011. 

Subtracting 1 from the day gives us January 20, 2011. 

Therefore, the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/20/2011. 

The correct answer is (C) 01/20/2011.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current year. Since Jane was born in 2001 and is now 16 years old, we can subtract 16 from 2001 to find the current year: 2001 - 16 = 1985.

Next, we need to determine the current month. Jane was born on the last day of February, so her birthday is on February 28th. Since today is her birthday, the current month is February.

Now, we need to determine the current day. Since today is Jane's birthday, the current day is February 28th.

Finally, we need to find the date one week from today. Since February has 28 days, adding one week (7 days) to February 28th will bring us to March 7th.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 03/07/2017.

Let's think step by step.
The last day of January 2012 is January 31, 2012. 

To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from January 31, 2012. 

Since January has 31 days, subtracting one month would take us to December 31, 2011. 

Therefore, the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 12/31/2011.

Let's think step by step.
First, let's convert the given date to the standard format of MM/DD/YYYY. The given date is 02/01/1987, which means it is January 2nd, 1987.

Next, we need to find the date 24 hours later. Since we are only considering the day, we can ignore the month and year for now.

If it is January 2nd, adding 24 hours would bring us to January 3rd.

Therefore, the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/03/1987.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the date 176 days after March 20, 2020. 

To do this, we can start by finding the number of days in each month from March to the current month (September). 

March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September has 13 days (since we are only counting up to the 13th day). 

Adding up these days, we get a total of 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 13 = 197 days. 

Since 176 days have passed since Jane quit her job, we need to subtract 176 from 197 to find the number of days remaining. 

197 - 176 = 21 days remaining. 

Therefore, the date 24 hours later will be September 13, 2020. 

The correct answer is (B) 09/13/2020.

Let's think step by step.
The original date of the concert was 06/01/1943. It was delayed by one day, so the new date is 06/02/1943. 

To find tomorrow's date, we add one day to the new date. 

06/02/1943 + 1 day = 06/03/1943

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date 24 hours later. Since today is 3/5, 24 hours later would be 3/6. 

Next, we need to determine the year. Since Jane is seeing a meteor shower for the second time in the year 1973, the year would still be 1973. 

Therefore, the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY format would be 03/06/1973.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the given date. 

First, let's subtract 1 year from 1987: 1987 - 1 = 1986

So, the year one year ago from today is 1986.

Next, let's look at the month. The given date is 02/01/1987, so the month is February.

To find the month one year ago, we subtract 1 from the month: February - 1 = January.

Now, let's look at the day. The given date is 02/01/1987, so the day is 01.

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 01/01/1986.

However, we need to format the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, so the answer is (B) 01/02/1986.

If Jane is celebrating the last day of January 2012, then the date is 01/31/2012.

To find the date 10 days ago, we subtract 10 days from 01/31/2012.

01/31/2012 - 10 days = 01/21/2012

Let's think step by step.
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

Since it is the last day of 1899, the date is 12/31/1899. 

Subtracting one month from December gives us November. 

So the date a month ago is 11/31/1899. 

However, November only has 30 days, so 11/31/1899 is not a valid date.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of the concert. The concert was originally scheduled for 06/01/1943, but was delayed by one day to today. Therefore, today's date is 06/02/1943.

Next, we need to find the date one week ago from today. To do this, we subtract 7 days from today's date.

06/02/1943 - 7 days = 05/26/1943

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the date 176 days after March 20, 2020. To do this, we can add 176 days to March 20, 2020.

March has 31 days, so we can subtract 31 from 176 to get 145 days remaining.
April has 30 days, so we can subtract 30 from 145 to get 115 days remaining.
May has 31 days, so we can subtract 31 from 115 to get 84 days remaining.
June has 30 days, so we can subtract 30 from 84 to get 54 days remaining.
July has 31 days, so we can subtract 31 from 54 to get 23 days remaining.
August has 31 days, so we can subtract 31 from 23 to get -8 days remaining.

Since we have a negative number of days remaining, we need to go back to the previous month, which is July. The date 176 days after March 20, 2020, is therefore July 14, 2020.

Now, we need to find the date one week before July 14, 2020. To do this, we can subtract 7 days from July 14, 2020.

July has 31 days, so we can subtract 7 from 14 to get 7 days remaining.

Therefore, one week before July 14, 2020, is July 7, 2020.

In MM/DD/YYYY format, the date one week ago from today is 07/07/2020.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date, 4/19/1969.

First, let's subtract 1 day from 4/19/1969: 4/18/1969.

Next, let's subtract another 1 day: 4/17/1969.

Today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 04/05/1973 (B) 03/05/1973 (C) 01/22/2007 (D) 01/02/1973 (E) 03/02/1973 (F) 03/08/1983
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of the meteor shower in 1973. Since it is Jane's second time seeing the meteor shower in 1973, we can assume that the first time she saw it was earlier in the year. 

Next, we need to determine the date of the first meteor shower in 1973. Since we don't have any information about the first meteor shower, we cannot determine the exact date. 

However, we do know that today is 3/5, so the first meteor shower must have occurred before today. Therefore, the date of the first meteor shower in 1973 could be any date before 3/5.

Since we don't have any information about the specific date of the first meteor shower, we cannot determine the exact date of today in MM/DD/YYYY format. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 01/22/2007.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(C) 01/22/2007

Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. Today is their golden wedding anniversary. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 08/02/2008 (B) 01/02/2085 (C) 12/04/2007 (D) 01/02/2008 (E) 01/11/2008 (F) 01/30/2008
Let's think step by step.
To find the date of their golden wedding anniversary, we need to add 50 years to their wedding date. 

Jan 2, 1958 + 50 years = Jan 2, 2008

So the date today is 01/02/2008. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 01/02/2008.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(D) 01/02/2008

Let's think step by step.
One week ago from today would be 7 days ago. Since it is the last day of 1899, we can subtract 7 days from December 31, 1899, to find the date one week ago.

December 31, 1899 - 7 days = December 24, 1899

So the date one week ago from today is 12/24/1899.

Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{\text{(C) }12/24/1899}$.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(C) }12/24/1899}$.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the correct date today. Since Jane thought today is 3/11/2002, but it is actually Mar 12, we know that today is 1 day later than what Jane thought. 

Next, we need to determine the date tomorrow. Since today is Mar 12, tomorrow will be Mar 13. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 03/13/2002.

Let's think step by step.
First, we know that the date is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that the month and day must be the same when read forwards and backwards.

Looking at the answer choices, we can eliminate (B), (C), (E), and (F) because the month and day are not the same when read forwards and backwards.

Now we are left with (A) and (D). To determine which one is correct, we need to check the year. The year must also be the same when read forwards and backwards.

Reading the year forwards and backwards, we see that 2020 is the same. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(A) } 02/02/2020}$.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(A) } 02/02/2020}$.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from April 30, 2021, we need to subtract 1 year from the year 2021. This gives us the year 2020. 

Next, we need to subtract 1 day from April 30, 2021. Since April has 30 days, subtracting 1 day gives us April 29, 2021. 

Therefore, the date one year ago from April 30, 2021, is April 29, 2020. 

In MM/DD/YYYY format, this is written as 04/29/2020.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the date 10 days ago from the current date. 

To do this, we can subtract 10 days from the current date. 

Since 176 days have passed since Jane quit her job on Mar 20, 2020, we can add 176 days to that date to find the current date. 

Mar 20, 2020 + 176 days = Sep 12, 2020 

Now, we can subtract 10 days from Sep 12, 2020 to find the date 10 days ago. 

Sep 12, 2020 - 10 days = Sep 2, 2020 

Therefore, the answer is (F) 09/02/2020.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(F) 09/02/2020.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of their golden wedding anniversary. A golden wedding anniversary is celebrated after 50 years of marriage. Since they married on Jan 2, 1958, their golden wedding anniversary would be on Jan 2, 2008.

Next, we need to find the date one year ago from today. Since today is their golden wedding anniversary on Jan 2, 2008, one year ago from today would be Jan 2, 2007.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 01/01/2007.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current date. Since 2015 is coming in 36 hours, we subtract 36 hours from the current time. 

Next, we need to convert the 36 hours into days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we divide 36 by 24 to get 1.5 days. 

Now, we subtract 1.5 days from the current date. 

If today is December 28th, 2014, subtracting 1.5 days would give us December 26th, 2014. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) 12/26/2014.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine if 2000 is a leap year. A leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. Since 2000 is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.

Next, we need to determine how many days are in February of a leap year. In a leap year, February has 29 days.

Since Jane was born on the last day of February in 2000, her birthday is on February 29, 2000.

To find the date today, we need to add 16 years to February 29, 2000. Since 2000 is a leap year, we need to account for the extra day in February.

Adding 16 years to 2000, we get 2016. Since 2016 is also a leap year, we need to add an extra day to February.

Therefore, the date today is February 29, 2016.

The answer is (D) 02/29/2016.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(D) 02/29/2016.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Jane's current visit to the bookstore. Since she visits on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009, we can count the number of months that have passed since October 2009 to find the current month.

Since October 2009, there have been 12 months in 2009, 12 months in 2010, and 1 month in 2011 (January). Therefore, a total of 25 months have passed.

Since Jane is on her 5th visit to the bookstore, we can subtract 5 months from the current month to find the month of her first visit. 25 - 5 = 20.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can subtract 12 from 20 to find the month of her first visit in the current year. 20 - 12 = 8.

Therefore, Jane's first visit in the current year was in August.

To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 1 day to the current date. Since we know the current date is the 16th, we add 1 to get 17.

Therefore, the date 24 hours later is August 17th.

Converting this to MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (B) 08/17/2010.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(B) 08/17/2010.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date, which is Jan 21, 2011.

To do this, we start by subtracting 1 day from Jan 21, 2011, which gives us Jan 20, 2011.

Next, we subtract another 1 day from Jan 20, 2011, which gives us Jan 19, 2011.

We continue this process until we have subtracted 10 days in total.

After subtracting 10 days, we arrive at Jan 11, 2011.

Therefore, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/11/2011.

Among the answer choices, the closest date to 01/11/2011 is 01/13/2011.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current date. Since the meeting is rescheduled to tomorrow, today's date is one day before the rescheduled meeting date.

Next, we need to subtract one day from the rescheduled meeting date, which is 10/16/1924. 

10/16/1924 - 1 day = 10/15/1924

Therefore, the current date today is 10/15/1924.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date a month ago. To do this, we need to subtract one month from the given date of 12/31/1929.

Since the given date is in December, subtracting one month would take us to November. Therefore, the month a month ago is November.

Next, we need to determine the number of days in November. November has 30 days.

So, a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format would be 11/30/1929.

However, this date is not one of the answer choices. Therefore, we made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's try again.

If yesterday was 12/31/1929, then a month ago would be 11/30/1929.

Looking at the answer choices, the closest date to 11/30/1929 is 12/01/1929.

Therefore, the correct answer is (F) 12/01/1929.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date today, we need to add 176 days to March 20, 2020. 

March has 31 days, so we can subtract 31 from 176 to get 145 days remaining. 

April has 30 days, so we can subtract another 30 from 145 to get 115 days remaining. 

May has 31 days, so we can subtract another 31 from 115 to get 84 days remaining. 

June has 30 days, so we can subtract another 30 from 84 to get 54 days remaining. 

July has 31 days, so we can subtract another 31 from 54 to get 23 days remaining. 

August has 31 days, so we can subtract another 31 from 23 to get -8 days remaining. 

Since we have a negative number of days remaining, we need to go back to the previous month, which is July. 

Therefore, the date today is July 23, 2020. 

Converting this to MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (E) 09/12/2020.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current year. Since Jane was born in 2001 and today is her 16th birthday, we can subtract 16 from 2001 to find the current year: 2001 - 16 = 1985.

Next, we need to determine the current month. Since Jane was born on the last day of February, her birthday will always fall on February 28th (or February 29th in a leap year). Therefore, the current month is February.

Now, we need to determine the current day. Since today is Jane's 16th birthday, we can subtract 16 from 28 (the last day of February) to find the current day: 28 - 16 = 12.

Putting it all together, the date yesterday is 02/12/1985.

Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 12/26/1959 (B) 01/02/1967 (C) 06/02/1960 (D) 01/02/2016 (E) 01/02/1960 (F) 12/19/1959
Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract one year from the current date. 

Since it is their 5-year anniversary today, we can calculate the current year by adding 5 years to the year they got married, which is 1958. 

So the current year is 1958 + 5 = 1963. 

To find the date one year ago from today, we subtract 1 year from the current year, which gives us 1963 - 1 = 1962. 

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 01/02/1962. 

Among the answer choices, the only option that matches this date is (E) 01/02/1960.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(E) 01/02/1960.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from today's date. 

Today's date is 07/09/YYYY. 

Subtracting 1 year from YYYY, we get 07/09/(YYYY-1). 

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 07/09/(YYYY-1). 

Since the question asks for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (F) 07/09/1971.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Jane's birthday. Since she was born on the last day of February in 2000, her birthday is on February 29th. 

Next, we need to determine the current year. Since today is her 16th birthday, we subtract 16 from 2000 to find the current year is 1984. 

Now, we can determine the date tomorrow. Since tomorrow is March 1st, the answer is 03/01/1984. 

However, none of the answer choices match this date. 

Let's consider the leap year rule. A leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. 

Since 2000 is divisible by 400, it is a leap year. Therefore, February has 29 days in 2000. 

Since Jane was born on the last day of February in a leap year, her birthday is on February 29th. 

Now, let's determine the current year. Since today is her 16th birthday, we subtract 16 from 2000 to find the current year is 1984. 

Since 1984 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. 

Therefore, the date tomorrow is March 1st, which is 03/01/1984. 

The correct answer is (C) 03/01/1984.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(C) 03/01/1984

To find the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to subtract one day from today's date. 

Today's date is 02/01/1987. 

To find yesterday's date, we subtract one day from the day component: 01. 

So, yesterday's date is 01/01/1987.

Let's think step by step.
One week ago from today would be 7 days before 02/01/1987. 

To find the date, we subtract 7 days from the day, which gives us 01/25/1987. 

However, since we are formatting the date in MM/DD/YYYY, the date would be 01/25/1987.

Let's think step by step.
First, let's find the date one year ago from 11/23/1933. To do this, we subtract 1 from the year: 1933 - 1 = 1932.

Next, we need to determine the month and day. Since we are going back one year, the month and day will remain the same. Therefore, the date one year ago from 11/23/1933 is 11/23/1932.

The correct answer is (D) 11/25/1932.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Thanksgiving in 2001. Since Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November, we can look at a calendar for November 2001 and find the fourth Thursday. In 2001, November 1st fell on a Thursday, so the fourth Thursday would be November 22nd.

Next, we need to find the date 24 hours later. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the date 24 hours later would be November 23rd.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(D) } 11/23/2002}$.

On May 9th, 2017 Jane bought 40 eggs. She ate one per day. Today she ran out of eggs. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 06/15/2017 (B) 07/17/2017 (C) 07/10/2017 (D) 06/18/2017 (E) 06/20/2017 (F) 06/19/2017
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many days it took for Jane to eat all the eggs. Since she bought the eggs on May 9th, and today she ran out of eggs, we need to count the number of days from May 9th to today. 

May has 31 days, so there are 31 - 9 = 22 days left in May after May 9th.
Since June has 30 days, there are 30 days in June.
So far, we have counted 22 + 30 = 52 days.

Now, we need to count the number of days in July. Since today is July 10th, there are 10 days in July.

Adding up all the days, we have 52 + 10 = 62 days.

Since Jane ate one egg per day, 24 hours later would be 62 + 1 = 63 days after May 9th.

Now, we need to find out which date is 63 days after May 9th. 

Starting from May 9th, we count 63 days forward. 

May has 31 days, so we subtract 31 from 63. We are left with 63 - 31 = 32 days.

June has 30 days, so we subtract 30 from 32. We are left with 32 - 30 = 2 days.

Therefore, 63 days after May 9th is June 2nd.

Converting June 2nd to MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (E) 06/02/2017.

However, none of the answer choices match June 2nd, so we made a mistake somewhere in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We made a mistake when counting the number of days in July. Today is July 10th, so there are 10 days in July, not 31.

Let's recalculate:

May has 31 days, so there are 31 - 9 = 22 days left in May after May 9th.
Since June has 30 days, there are 30 days in June.
So far, we have counted 22 + 30 = 52 days.

Now, we need to count the number of days in July. Since today is July 10th, there are 10 days in July.

Adding up all the days, we have 52 + 10 = 62 days.

Since Jane ate one egg per day, 24 hours later

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out the date of Jane's first visit to the bookstore. Since she visits on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009, her first visit would have been on 10/16/2009.

Next, we need to find out the date of Jane's most recent visit to the bookstore. Since it is her 5th visit today, we can count back 5 months from the current month. Today is September 2020, so 5 months ago would be April 2020. Therefore, her most recent visit would have been on 04/16/2020.

Now, we need to find the date one year ago from today. Since today is September 2020, one year ago would be September 2019. Therefore, the date one year ago from today would be 09/16/2019.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of the palindrome day in MM/DD/YYYY format. Since the date is the same backwards as forwards, the month and day must be the same. Therefore, the date is either 01/02/YYYY or 02/02/YYYY.

Next, we need to determine the year. Since the problem states that today is the palindrome day of 2020, the year must be 2020. Therefore, the date is either 01/02/2020 or 02/02/2020.

Now, we need to find the date a month ago. Since today is the palindrome day of 2020, the date a month ago must be the same as the current date, but with the month decreased by 1. Therefore, the date a month ago is either 12/02/2020 or 01/02/2020.

Since the answer choices are in MM/DD/YYYY format, we can eliminate 12/02/2020 as a possible answer. Therefore, the date a month ago is 01/02/2020.

The answer is $\boxed{\text{(C) } 01/02/2020}$.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date 24 hours after Jan 21, 2011. 

To do this, we add 24 hours to the given date. 

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the date 24 hours later will be Jan 22, 2011. 

However, this is not one of the answer choices. 

To find the correct answer choice, we need to convert the date format to MM/DD/YYYY. 

The date Jan 22, 2011, in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/22/2011. 

Again, this is not one of the answer choices. 

Therefore, none of the given answer choices match the date 24 hours later.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of the concert. The concert was originally scheduled for 06/01/1943 but was delayed by one day. Therefore, the concert took place on 06/02/1943.

Next, we need to find the date that is one month before the concert. To do this, we subtract one month from the concert date. 

Since the concert took place in June, one month before would be May. Therefore, the date a month ago would be 05/02/1943.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 05/02/1943.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Thanksgiving in 2001. Since Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November, we can count back from the fourth Thursday of November 2001 to find the date of Thanksgiving. 

The fourth Thursday of November 2001 is November 22nd. Therefore, Thanksgiving in 2001 is on November 22nd.

Next, we need to find the date one week from today. Since today is Thanksgiving in 2001, one week from today would be November 29th, 2001.

Finally, we need to convert the date to MM/DD/YYYY format. Therefore, the answer is (F) 11/29/2002.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many days it took for Jane to run out of eggs. Since she bought 40 eggs and ate one per day, it took her 40 days to run out of eggs.

Next, we need to find the date a month ago. To do this, we subtract 30 days from today's date. 

Since today is May 9th, 2017, a month ago would be April 9th, 2017.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 05/04/2017.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Jane's current visit to the bookstore. Since she visits on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009, we can count the number of months that have passed since October 2009 to find the current month.

Since October 2009, there have been 12 months in 2009, 12 months in 2010, and 4 months in 2011 (up to April). Therefore, a total of 28 months have passed.

Since Jane is on her 5th visit to the bookstore today, we can subtract 5 from the current month to find the month of her first visit.

28 - 5 = 23

Therefore, Jane's first visit to the bookstore was in the 23rd month, which is November 2011.

Now, we need to find the date 10 days ago from today's date. Since today is the 16th, we subtract 10 from 16 to find the date 10 days ago.

16 - 10 = 6

Therefore, the date 10 days ago is the 6th of the current month.

Putting it all together, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 11/06/2011.

However, none of the answer choices match this date. Therefore, there may be an error in the problem or the answer choices.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of their 5-year anniversary. To do this, we add 5 years to the original date of their marriage: Jan 2, 1958 + 5 years = Jan 2, 1963.

Next, we need to find the date one week from Jan 2, 1963. To do this, we add 7 days to Jan 2, 1963: Jan 2, 1963 + 7 days = Jan 9, 1963.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 01/09/1963.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the given date. 

First, let's subtract 1 from the year: 1924 - 1 = 1923.

Next, let's look at the month and day. The given date is 10/16/1924, so the month and day are 10/16.

To find the date one year ago, we keep the same month and day but change the year to 1923. 

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 10/16/1923.

However, none of the answer choices match this date exactly. 

Let's check the answer choices and see which one is closest to 10/16/1923.

(A) 09/16/1923 - This is one month before 10/16/1923, so it is not the correct answer.
(B) 10/14/1923 - This is two days before 10/16/1923, so it is not the correct answer.
(C) 07/11/1923 - This is three months before 10/16/1923, so it is not the correct answer.
(D) 10/06/1923 - This is ten days before 10/16/1923, so it is not the correct answer.
(E) 10/15/1923 - This is one day before 10/16/1923, so it is the closest answer.
(F) 10/13/1923 - This is three days before 10/16/1923, so it is not the correct answer.

Therefore, the closest answer is (E) 10/15/1923.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current date. 

Since today is the last day of 1899, subtracting 1 year would give us the last day of 1898. 

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 12/31/1898.

Let's think step by step.
Since the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, we can determine that the first Monday of 2019 is January 7th, 2019. 

To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from January 7th, 2019. 

Since there are 31 days in January, subtracting one month would bring us to December 7th, 2018. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(D) }12/07/2018}$.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the number of days in the month of February in 1966. Since it is not a leap year, February has 28 days.

Next, we need to determine the number of days in the month of March in 1966. Since it is not specified in the question, we will assume that March has 31 days.

Therefore, the date tomorrow would be March 3rd, 1966.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current year. Since Jane got her job in 2016 and it is her 3-year work anniversary, we can calculate the current year by adding 3 to 2016: 2016 + 3 = 2019.

Next, we need to determine the current month and day. Since today is her 3-year work anniversary, we can assume that it is the same month and day as her start date. Therefore, the current month and day are December 2.

Now, we need to find the date one week from today. To do this, we add 7 days to the current month and day: December 2 + 7 days = December 9.

Finally, we need to format the date in MM/DD/YYYY format. Therefore, the answer is 12/09/2019.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from the current date. 

Starting with Sept. 1st, 2021, subtracting 7 days gives us Aug. 25th, 2021.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the day of the week for September 9, 1909. We can use a calendar or a day of the week calculator to find that it was a Thursday.

Next, we need to find the date one week from September 9, 1909. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can simply add 7 days to September 9, 1909.

September 10, 1909 is one day after September 9, 1909.
September 11, 1909 is two days after September 9, 1909.
September 12, 1909 is three days after September 9, 1909.
September 13, 1909 is four days after September 9, 1909.
September 14, 1909 is five days after September 9, 1909.
September 15, 1909 is six days after September 9, 1909.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many months have passed since October 2009 to the present day. Since it is her 5th visit to the bookstore today, we can subtract 5 from the current month to find out how many months have passed. 

Since it is currently the 16th of the month, we can assume that Jane has already visited the bookstore this month. Therefore, we subtract 1 from the current month. 

Now, let's calculate the number of months that have passed since October 2009. 

Since October 2009, there have been:
- 2 months in 2009 (October and November)
- 12 months in 2010
- 12 months in 2011
- 12 months in 2012
- 12 months in 2013
- 12 months in 2014
- 12 months in 2015
- 12 months in 2016
- 12 months in 2017
- 12 months in 2018
- 12 months in 2019
- 12 months in 2020
- 2 months in 2021 (January and February)

Adding all these months together, we get a total of 2 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 2 = 134 months.

Now, let's determine the current month. Since it is her 5th visit to the bookstore today, we subtract 5 from the current month. 

If we subtract 5 from 134, we get 129. 

Therefore, the current month is the 129th month since October 2009. 

To find the current year, we divide 129 by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year) and round down to the nearest whole number. 

129 ÷ 12 = 10.75

Rounding down, we get 10. 

Therefore, the current year is 2009 + 10 = 2019. 

Finally, we can determine the current month and day. 

Since it is her 5th visit to the bookstore today, we subtract 5 from the current month. 

If we subtract 5 from 129, we get 124. 

Therefore, the current month is the 124th month since October 2009. 

To find the current month and day, we divide

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 1 day to the current date. 

Since it is their 5-year anniversary today, we need to add 5 years to the current year. 

The current date is Jan 2, 1958. 

Adding 1 day to Jan 2, 1958, gives us Jan 3, 1958. 

Adding 5 years to 1958 gives us 1963. 

Therefore, the date 24 hours later is Jan 3, 1963. 

In MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (D) 01/03/1964.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

Starting with July 29, 2002, if we subtract one month, we get June 29, 2002. 

However, the answer choices are in MM/DD/YYYY format, so we need to convert the date to that format. 

Therefore, the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 06/29/2002. 

Looking at the answer choices, the closest option is (C) 06/28/2002. 

However, since the question asks for the date a month ago, we need to subtract one day from the given date. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 06/27/2002.

Let's think step by step.
One week ago from today would be 7 days ago. To find the date 7 days ago, we subtract 7 from the day of the month, which is 2. This gives us -5. Since we cannot have a negative day, we need to borrow from the month. 

Since it is the second day of the month, we need to borrow 1 month. This means we need to go back to the previous month, which is February. 

Now we have 28 days in February, so we subtract 5 from 28, which gives us 23. 

Therefore, one week ago from today would be February 23, 1966. 

The answer is (E) 02/23/1966.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(E) 02/23/1966.

Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 02/03/2017 (B) 01/28/2017 (C) 01/21/2017 (D) 11/12/2016 (E) 01/14/2017
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current year. Since Jane was born in 2001 and she is now 16 years old, we can subtract 16 from 2001 to find the current year: 2001 - 16 = 1985.

Next, we need to determine the current month. Since Jane was born on the last day of February, her birthday is on February 28th. To find the current month, we can subtract 16 years from February 28, 1985: February 28, 1985 - 16 years = February 28, 1985.

Now, we need to determine the date a month ago. Since February has 28 days, we can subtract 28 days from February 28, 1985 to find the date a month ago: February 28, 1985 - 28 days = January 31, 1985.

Finally, we can write the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format: 01/31/1985.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 01/21/2017.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(C) 01/21/2017.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the given date. 

First, let's subtract 1 year from 2019: 2019 - 1 = 2018.

Next, let's look at the month. The given date is 11/12/2019, so the month is 11.

Now, let's look at the day. The given date is 11/12/2019, so the day is 12.

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 11/12/2018.

However, none of the answer choices match this date. 

Let's try another approach. 

We can start by subtracting 1 year from the year 2019: 2019 - 1 = 2018.

Next, let's look at the month. The given date is 11/12/2019, so the month is 11.

Now, let's look at the day. The given date is 11/12/2019, so the day is 12.

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 11/12/2018.

Again, none of the answer choices match this date.

Let's try one more approach.

We can start by subtracting 1 year from the year 2019: 2019 - 1 = 2018.

Next, let's look at the month. The given date is 11/12/2019, so the month is 11.

Now, let's look at the day. The given date is 11/12/2019, so the day is 12.

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 11/12/2018.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one week from September 1st, 2021, we need to add 7 days to that date. 

September has 30 days, so adding 7 days to September 1st will bring us to September 8th.

To find the date tomorrow, we need to add one day to their 5-year anniversary date. 

Their 5-year anniversary date is Jan 2, 1963. 

Adding one day to Jan 2, 1963, gives us Jan 3, 1963.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Jane's birthday. Since she was born on the last day of February in 2001, her birthday is on February 28th.

Next, we need to determine the current date. Since today is her 16th birthday, we can subtract 16 years from the current year, which is 2017. This gives us the year 2001.

Now, we can determine the date tomorrow. Since tomorrow is March 1st, the answer is 03/01/2001.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Thanksgiving in 2001. Since Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November, we can count back from the fourth Thursday of November 2001 to find the date of Thanksgiving.

The fourth Thursday of November 2001 is November 22nd. Therefore, Thanksgiving in 2001 was on November 22nd.

Now, we need to find the date yesterday, which is one day before November 22nd, 2001.

Subtracting one day from November 22nd, 2001, we get November 21st, 2001.

Therefore, the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format is 11/21/2001.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the correct date today. Since Jane thought today is 3/11/2002 and it is actually 1 day later, the correct date today is 3/12/2002.

Next, we need to find the date one week from today. To do this, we add 7 days to the current date of 3/12/2002.

Adding 7 days to 3/12/2002, we get 3/19/2002.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from 4/19/1969, we need to subtract 1 year from the given date. 

First, let's subtract 1 from the year: 
1969 - 1 = 1968

So, the year one year ago from 4/19/1969 is 1968.

Next, let's look at the month and day. Since we are subtracting a year, the month and day will remain the same.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date a month ago from April 30, 2021, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

April has 30 days, so if we subtract one month, we will end up in March. 

Therefore, the date a month ago from April 30, 2021, is in March. 

Now, we need to determine the specific date in March. 

The answer choices are: 
(A) 03/18/2021

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date that is ten years ago from May 6, 1992. To do this, we subtract 10 years from the year 1992, which gives us 1982. Therefore, the date ten years ago from May 6, 1992, is May 6, 1982.

Next, we need to find the date one week ago from today. To do this, we subtract 7 days from the current date. However, the current date is not given in the problem, so we cannot determine the exact date one week ago.

However, we can eliminate answer choices that do not fall within the month of May. Answer choices (B), (C), and (E) are all in different months, so we can eliminate them.

Now, we are left with answer choices (A), (D), and (F). We know that the date one week ago from May 6, 1992, must be in the month of May. Therefore, we can eliminate answer choice (A) since it is in the month of April.

This leaves us with answer choices (D) and (F). To determine which one is correct, we need to know the current date. Without that information, we cannot determine the exact date one week ago.

Therefore, the answer is inconclusive without additional information.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract 30 days from the current date. 

Since 176 days have passed since Jane quit her job on Mar 20, 2020, we can calculate the current date by adding 176 days to Mar 20, 2020.

Mar 20, 2020 + 176 days = Sep 12, 2020

Now, to find the date a month ago, we subtract 30 days from Sep 12, 2020.

Sep 12, 2020 - 30 days = Aug 13, 2020

Therefore, the date a month ago is 08/13/2020.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date. 

Since the given date is 9/7, subtracting one month would give us 8/7. 

However, none of the answer choices match this date. 

To find the correct answer, we need to consider the fact that the NFL season typically starts in September. 

Therefore, if Jane is watching NFL 2003 on 9/7, it is likely that the game is being played in the current season. 

This means that the date a month ago would be in the previous year, 2002. 

Looking at the answer choices, the only option from the previous year is (C) 06/01/2003. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 06/01/2003.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one week ago from April 30, 2021, we need to subtract 7 days from that date. 

April has 30 days, so if we subtract 7 days, we will end up in the previous month, March. 

Therefore, the date one week ago from April 30, 2021, is in March. 

The answer choices given are all in April or May, so we can eliminate choices (A), (D), and (F) since they are not in March. 

Now we are left with choices (B), (C), and (E). 

To determine which of these is the correct answer, we need to count back 7 days from April 30, 2021. 

April 30, 2021 - 7 days = April 23, 2021.

Today is the second day of the third month of 1966. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 03/02/1966 (B) 03/03/1965 (C) 03/03/2021 (D) 03/04/1966 (E) 03/03/1966 (F) 04/03/1966
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date 24 hours later. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the date will remain the same, but the day will change.

The given date is the second day of the third month of 1966. So, the date is 03/02/1966.

To find the date 24 hours later, we add 1 to the day. Therefore, the date 24 hours later is 03/03/1966.

The answer is $\boxed{\text{(E) } 03/03/1966}$.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(E) } 03/03/1966}$.

In the US, Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. Today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 01/16/2003 (B) 08/24/2002 (C) 11/23/2002 (D) 11/22/2002 (E) 09/04/2002 (F) 11/21/2002
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the day of the week for Thanksgiving in 2001. To do this, we can use the fact that Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November. In 2001, November 1st fell on a Thursday, so we can count 3 Thursdays forward to find Thanksgiving.

November 1, 2001 (Thursday)
November 8, 2001 (Thursday)
November 15, 2001 (Thursday)
November 22, 2001 (Thursday) - Thanksgiving

Therefore, Thanksgiving in 2001 fell on November 22nd.

Now, we need to determine the number of days between November 22, 2001, and today. We can count the number of years and days separately.

Years: Today is 2022, and Thanksgiving in 2001 was 21 years ago.

Days: We can count the number of days from November 22, 2001, to November 22, 2021 (the last Thanksgiving before 2022). There are 365 days in a year, so we have:

21 years * 365 days/year = 7,665 days

Now, we need to add the number of days from November 22, 2021, to today. Since we are counting forward, we add 1 day for each day after November 22, 2021, until today.

From November 22, 2021, to November 22, 2022, there are 365 days. However, we need to add 1 more day to include today.

365 days + 1 day = 366 days

Therefore, the total number of days from November 22, 2001, to today is:

7,665 days + 366 days = 8,031 days

Now, we can add 8,031 days to November 22, 2001, to find today's date.

November 22, 2001 + 8,031 days = November 21, 2022

Therefore, today's date is 11/21/2022.

None of the answer choices match 11/21/2022, so the correct answer is not listed.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer isNone of the above.

Jane scheduled 3 apointments with 5 poeple for tomorrow (Tue, 7/9/1972). What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 07/03/1972 (B) 10/28/1971 (C) 06/14/1972 (D) 06/28/1972 (E) 06/23/1972 (F) 09/28/1972
Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago from 7/9/1972, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date. 

Starting with 7/9/1972, we subtract 1 day at a time until we reach 10 days. 

7/9/1972 - 1 day = 7/8/1972
7/8/1972 - 1 day = 7/7/1972
7/7/1972 - 1 day = 7/6/1972
7/6/1972 - 1 day = 7/5/1972
7/5/1972 - 1 day = 7/4/1972
7/4/1972 - 1 day = 7/3/1972
7/3/1972 - 1 day = 7/2/1972
7/2/1972 - 1 day = 7/1/1972
7/1/1972 - 1 day = 6/30/1972
6/30/1972 - 1 day = 6/29/1972

Therefore, the date 10 days ago from 7/9/1972 is 6/29/1972.

Converting this to MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (D) 06/29/1972.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(D) 06/29/1972

Let's think step by step.
One week ago from today would be 7 days before May 4, 2004. 

To find the date, we subtract 7 days from May 4, 2004. 

May 4, 2004 - 7 days = April 27, 2004. 

So the answer is (C) 04/28/2004.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of the palindrome day. Since the MMDDYYYY format is the same backwards as forwards, the date must be in the form MM/DD/YYYY, where MM and DD are the same. The only possible date that satisfies this condition is 02/02/2020.

Next, we need to find the date 24 hours later. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the date will be the same, but with the day incremented by 1. Therefore, the date 24 hours later is 02/03/2020.

The answer is $\boxed{\text{(D) } 02/03/2020}$.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is$\boxed{\text{(D) } 02/03/2020}$.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from today's date. 

Today's date is January 21, 2011. 

Subtracting 1 year, we get January 21, 2010. 

Therefore, the date one year ago from today is 01/21/2010.

Let's think step by step.
Jane got her job in 2016, so her 3-year work anniversary would be in 2019. 

To find the date tomorrow, we need to know the current date. Since the problem does not provide the current date, we cannot determine the exact date tomorrow. 

However, we do know that Jane spilled coffee on her laptop on her second day at work, which was on December 2. 

If today is December 2, then tomorrow would be December 3.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the given date, which is 07/09/1972.

First, let's subtract one month from the month of July. Since July is the 7th month, subtracting one month would give us June, the 6th month.

So, the month a month ago is June.

Next, let's look at the day. Since we are subtracting one month, the day will remain the same, which is 09.

So, the day a month ago is 09.

Finally, let's look at the year. Since we are subtracting one month from 1972, the year will remain the same.

So, the year a month ago is 1972.

Putting it all together, the date a month ago is 06/09/1972.

However, none of the answer choices match this date exactly. The closest option is (A) 06/08/1972, which is one day off. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 06/08/1972.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many days have passed since Jan 21, 2011. 

To do this, we need to count the number of days Jane ate the pizzas and wings. 

Since Jane ate 2 pizzas and 5 wings, she ate a total of 2 + 5 = 7 items. 

Next, we need to determine how many days it takes for Jane to eat 7 items. 

Let's assume Jane eats 1 item per day. 

Therefore, it would take Jane 7 days to eat 7 items. 

Now, we need to add these 7 days to Jan 21, 2011. 

Jan 21, 2011 + 7 days = Jan 28, 2011. 

Therefore, the date today is Jan 28, 2011.

To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the date of their golden wedding anniversary. 

Their golden wedding anniversary is 50 years after their wedding, so it would be on Jan 2, 2008. 

To find the date yesterday, we subtract one day from Jan 2, 2008. 

Therefore, the date yesterday is Jan 1, 2008. 

In MM/DD/YYYY format, the date yesterday is 01/01/2008.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Thanksgiving in 2000. Since Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November, we can count back one year from the given date of Thanksgiving in 2001. 

So, Thanksgiving in 2000 would be on the fourth Thursday of November 2000. 

To determine the date, we need to know the day of the week for November 1, 2000. We can use a calendar or a website to find this information. 

Let's assume that November 1, 2000, is a Wednesday. 

Since Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday, we count back from November 1, 2000, four Thursdays. 

November 1, 2000 (Wednesday)
October 26, 2000 (Thursday)
October 19, 2000 (Thursday)
October 12, 2000 (Thursday)
October 5, 2000 (Thursday)

Therefore, Thanksgiving in 2000 would be on October 5, 2000. 

Now, we need to express this date in MM/DD/YYYY format.

Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 12/23/1915 (B) 12/22/1960 (C) 10/09/1960 (D) 12/23/1960 (E) 12/30/1960 (F) 12/23/2003
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the current year. Since it is their 5-year anniversary, we can add 5 years to 1958 to find the current year: 1958 + 5 = 1963.

Next, we need to determine the current month and day. Since their anniversary is on January 2nd, we know that the current month is January and the current day is 2.

Now, we need to find the date 10 days ago. To do this, we subtract 10 from the current day: 2 - 10 = -8.

Since the result is negative, we need to borrow from the month. We subtract 1 from the current month and add the number of days in the previous month (31) to the current day: January - 1 = December, 31 + 2 = 33.

So, the date 10 days ago is December 33rd.

However, December only has 31 days, so we need to subtract 31 from the current day: 33 - 31 = 2.

Therefore, the date 10 days ago is December 2nd.

Putting it all together, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 12/02/1963.

None of the answer choices match this date, so none of the given options are correct.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer isNone of the above.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date of 5/4/2004.

First, let's subtract the days: 4 - 10 = -6.

Since we have a negative number, we need to borrow from the month. We borrow 1 month, which means we subtract 1 from the month and add the number of days in that month to the negative days.

April has 30 days, so -6 + 30 = 24.

Now we have a positive number, so the date 10 days ago is 4/24/2004.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 04/24/2004.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(C) 04/24/2004.

Let's think step by step.
To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the current date. Since it is their 5-year anniversary today, we need to subtract 5 years from the current date. 

Starting with January 2, 1958, we subtract 5 years, which brings us to January 2, 1953. 

Now, we need to subtract one day from January 2, 1953. 

Since January 2 is not a leap year, we subtract one day from the total number of days in a non-leap year, which is 365. 

365 - 1 = 364

Therefore, the date yesterday is January 1, 1953. 

In MM/DD/YYYY format, the answer is (A) 01/01/1953.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(A) 01/01/1953

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the number of days between today and the date Jane booked her flight. 

To do this, we subtract the given date (Jul 29, 2002) from today's date. 

Today's date is not provided in the question, so we cannot determine the exact number of days. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact date in MM/DD/YYYY format.

Jane got her job in 2016. Today is her 3-year work anniversary. She still remember that on Dec 2, her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY? Answer Choices: (A) 08/04/2019 (B) 11/01/2089 (C) 09/06/2019 (D) 11/01/2019 (E) 11/01/1933 (F) 11/02/2019
Let's think step by step.
Jane got her job in 2016, so her work anniversary would be in 2019. Since today is her 3-year work anniversary, we can subtract 3 years from the current year to find the year she started her job: 2019 - 3 = 2016.

On her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop, which happened on Dec 2. To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from Dec 2. 

Since Dec is the 12th month, subtracting one month would bring us to Nov. So the date a month ago would be Nov 2.

Therefore, the answer is (F) 11/02/2019.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(F) 11/02/2019.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the date that is 3 days after April 10, 1985. To do this, we add 3 days to April 10, 1985.

April 10 + 3 days = April 13

So, the date that is 3 days after April 10, 1985 is April 13, 1985.

Next, we need to find the date that is 24 hours after April 13, 1985. To do this, we add 1 day to April 13, 1985.

April 13 + 1 day = April 14

So, the date that is 24 hours after April 13, 1985 is April 14, 1985.

Therefore, the answer is (F) 04/10/1985.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is(F) 04/10/1985.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the date of Thanksgiving in 2001. Since Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November, we can count back from the last day of November in 2001. 

The last day of November in 2001 is November 30th. Counting back four Thursdays, we get November 29th, November 22nd, November 15th, and finally, November 8th. 

So, Thanksgiving in 2001 was on November 22nd. 

Now, we need to find the date 10 days before November 22nd, 2001. 

Counting back 10 days from November 22nd, we get November 12th. 

Therefore, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 11/12/2001. 

However, none of the answer choices match this date. It seems there may be an error in the given answer choices.
