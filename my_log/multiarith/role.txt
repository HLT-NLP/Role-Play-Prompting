1st data
For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
To determine how long the candy will last Megan, we need to calculate the total number of candy pieces she received and divide it by the number of pieces she eats per day.

Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her sister, so the total number of candy pieces is 11 + 5 = 16.

If Megan eats 8 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of candy pieces (16) by the number of pieces she eats per day (8):

16 / 8 = 2

Therefore, the candy will last Megan for 2 days.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
To find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked. 

Bianca picked 26 carrots, and her mother picked 15 carrots. So, the total number of carrots picked is 26 + 15 = 41.

Out of these 41 carrots, only 16 were good. Therefore, the number of bad carrots is 41 - 16 = 25.

So, Bianca and her mom had 25 bad carrots.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is25.

Paige and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 4 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds, how many points did they earn?
To find out how many points Paige and her friends earned, we need to calculate the total weight of the recycled paper and then divide it by 4 to determine the number of points.

Paige recycled 14 pounds, and her friends recycled 2 pounds. So, the total weight of recycled paper is 14 + 2 = 16 pounds.

Now, we divide the total weight by 4 to find the number of points: 16 ÷ 4 = 4.

Therefore, Paige and her friends earned a total of 4 points for recycling the paper.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is4 points.

In fourth grade there were 4 students at the start of the year. During the year 3 students left and 42 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
To find the total number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the number of new students who joined and then add that to the initial number of students.

Initial number of students = 4
Number of students who left = 3
Number of new students who joined = 42

To calculate the total number of students at the end of the year, we can use the following formula:

Total number of students = Initial number of students + Number of new students - Number of students who left

Total number of students = 4 + 42 - 3
Total number of students = 43

Therefore, there were 43 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

A toy store had 4 giant stuffed bears in stock when they got another shipment with 10 bears in it. The put the bears onto shelves with 7 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?
To find out how many shelves were used, we need to divide the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf.

The toy store initially had 4 giant stuffed bears in stock. When they received a shipment of 10 more bears, the total number of bears became 4 + 10 = 14 bears.

Since there were 7 bears on each shelf, we can divide the total number of bears (14) by the number of bears on each shelf (7) to find the number of shelves used.

14 bears ÷ 7 bears per shelf = 2 shelves

Therefore, the toy store used 2 shelves to display all the bears.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2 shelves.

Bianca was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 8 books on it. If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
To find the total number of books Bianca had, we need to calculate the number of books on each type of shelf and then add them together.

For the mystery books:
Number of shelves = 5
Number of books per shelf = 8
Total number of mystery books = 5 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 40 books

For the picture books:
Number of shelves = 4
Number of books per shelf = 8
Total number of picture books = 4 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 32 books

To find the total number of books, we add the number of mystery books and picture books together:
Total number of books = 40 mystery books + 32 picture books = 72 books

Therefore, Bianca had a total of 72 books.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is72.

Megan baked 68 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 32 of them how many packages could she make if she put 6 cupcake in each package?
To find out how many packages Megan could make, we need to determine the number of cupcakes she has left after her brother ate some. 

Megan initially baked 68 cupcakes, and her brother ate 32 of them. Therefore, the number of cupcakes remaining is:

68 - 32 = 36 cupcakes

Now, we can calculate the number of packages Megan can make by dividing the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package:

36 cupcakes ÷ 6 cupcakes/package = 6 packages

So, Megan can make 6 packages of cupcakes with the remaining 36 cupcakes.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6 packages.

To find the total number of candies Adam has, we need to calculate the number of candies in each type of candy and then add them together.

Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candy, and each box has 4 pieces. So, the total number of chocolate candies is 2 boxes * 4 pieces per box = 8 chocolate candies.

Similarly, Adam bought 5 boxes of caramel candy, and each box has 4 pieces. Therefore, the total number of caramel candies is 5 boxes * 4 pieces per box = 20 caramel candies.

To find the total number of candies, we add the number of chocolate candies and caramel candies together: 8 chocolate candies + 20 caramel candies = 28 candies.

So, Adam has a total of 28 candies.

Wendy picked 103 flowers for her friend’s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 47 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?
To find out how many bouquets Wendy can still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked.

Total flowers picked = 103
Wilted flowers = 47

To find the number of flowers that are still usable, we subtract the wilted flowers from the total flowers picked:

Usable flowers = Total flowers picked - Wilted flowers
Usable flowers = 103 - 47
Usable flowers = 56

Now, we can determine the number of bouquets Wendy can make by dividing the number of usable flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet:

Number of bouquets = Usable flowers / Flowers in each bouquet
Number of bouquets = 56 / 8
Number of bouquets = 7

Therefore, Wendy can still make 7 bouquets for her friend's wedding.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is7.

Total number of red apples ordered = 6
Total number of green apples ordered = 15

Total number of apples ordered = 6 + 15 = 21

Number of students who wanted fruit = 5

Number of extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of students who wanted fruit
                                 = 21 - 5
                                 = 16

Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy.
He gave 5 boxes to his little brother.

So, the number of boxes Kaleb still has is 14 - 5 = 9 boxes.

Since each box contains 6 pieces of chocolate candy, we can multiply the number of boxes Kaleb still has by the number of pieces in each box to find the total number of pieces he still has.

9 boxes * 6 pieces per box = 54 pieces

Therefore, Kaleb still has 54 pieces of chocolate candy.

In this case, the total number of enemies is 7, and you destroy all but 2 of them. So, the number of enemies defeated would be 7 - 2 = 5.

Now, we can calculate the points earned by multiplying the number of enemies defeated (5) by the points awarded per enemy (8):

Points earned = Number of enemies defeated × Points awarded per enemy
              = 5 × 8
              = 40

Therefore, you would earn 40 points by defeating all but 2 enemies in the level.

In fourth grade there were 33 students at the start of the year. During the year 18 students left and 14 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students and then add the number of new students who joined.

Initial number of students = 33
Number of students who left = 18
Number of new students who joined = 14

To find the number of students at the end, we can use the following equation:

Number of students at the end = Initial number of students - Number of students who left + Number of new students who joined

Number of students at the end = 33 - 18 + 14

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Number of students at the end = 33 - 18 + 14
Number of students at the end = 15 + 14
Number of students at the end = 29

Therefore, there were 29 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 5 players quit. If each player left had 5 lives, how many lives did they have total?
Initially, there were 8 friends playing the video game online, and each player had 5 lives. So, the total number of lives at the beginning was 8 players multiplied by 5 lives per player, which equals 40 lives.

After 5 players quit, we need to subtract their lives from the total. Since each player had 5 lives, the number of lives subtracted would be 5 lives per player multiplied by 5 players, which equals 25 lives.

Therefore, the total number of lives remaining after 5 players quit would be 40 lives minus 25 lives, which equals 15 lives.

Hence, the remaining players would have a total of 15 lives.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is15.

Edward made 37 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 21 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 2 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
To find out how many 2-dollar games Edward can buy, we need to subtract the amount he spent on mower blades from the total amount he made mowing lawns.

Total amount Edward made = $37
Amount spent on mower blades = $21

Amount left after buying mower blades = Total amount - Amount spent on mower blades
Amount left = $37 - $21 = $16

Now, we can determine how many 2-dollar games Edward can buy with the remaining $16. We divide the amount left by the cost of each game:

Number of 2-dollar games = Amount left / Cost of each game
Number of 2-dollar games = $16 / $2 = 8

Therefore, Edward can buy 8 2-dollar games with the money he has left.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is8.

Isabel had 72 homework problems. She finished 32 of them but still had 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Isabel finished from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of problems Isabel had = 72
Number of problems Isabel finished = 32

Remaining number of problems = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
Remaining number of problems = 72 - 32
Remaining number of problems = 40

Since Isabel still had 5 pages of problems to do, we can divide the remaining number of problems by 5 to find out how many problems are on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Remaining number of problems / Number of pages
Number of problems on each page = 40 / 5
Number of problems on each page = 8

Therefore, there are 8 problems on each page.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is8.

To determine the number of baggies Robin can make, we need to find the total number of cookies she has and divide it by the number of cookies in each bag.

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Robin has:
23 chocolate chip cookies + 25 oatmeal cookies = 48 cookies

Now, we can find the number of baggies Robin can make by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag:
48 cookies ÷ 6 cookies/bag = 8 baggies

Therefore, Robin can make 8 baggies of cookies.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is8.

To find the number of bad carrots, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked. 

Olivia picked 20 carrots, her mother picked 14, so the total number of carrots picked is 20 + 14 = 34.

Since only 19 of the carrots were good, we subtract 19 from the total number of carrots picked: 34 - 19 = 15.

Therefore, Olivia and her mom had 15 bad carrots.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is15.

Nancy has 17 math problems + 15 spelling problems = 32 problems in total.

If she can finish 8 problems in an hour, we can divide the total number of problems by the number of problems she can complete in an hour:

32 problems ÷ 8 problems/hour = 4 hours.

A trivia team had 12 members total, but during a game 4 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 8 points, how many points were scored total?
To find the total number of points scored, we need to determine the number of members who showed up and multiply it by the points scored per member.

Given that there were initially 12 members and 4 didn't show up, the number of members who did show up is 12 - 4 = 8.

Since each member scored 8 points, the total number of points scored is 8 (points per member) multiplied by 8 (number of members who showed up) = 64 points.

Therefore, a total of 64 points were scored.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is64.

To determine how long Frank's money will last him, we need to calculate his total earnings and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

Frank earned $5 mowing lawns and $58 weed eating, so his total earnings are $5 + $58 = $63.

If Frank spends $7 per week, we can divide his total earnings ($63) by his weekly expenses ($7) to find out how many weeks the money will last.

$63 / $7 = 9

Therefore, Frank's money will last him for 9 weeks.

Kaleb was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday he filled 4 bags up and on Sunday he filled 6 more bags. If each bag had 4 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total?
To find the total number of cans Kaleb picked up, we need to calculate the number of cans in each bag and then add them together.

On Saturday, Kaleb filled 4 bags, and since each bag had 4 cans, the total number of cans on Saturday is 4 bags * 4 cans/bag = 16 cans.

On Sunday, he filled 6 more bags, so the total number of bags on Sunday is 4 bags + 6 bags = 10 bags. Since each bag has 4 cans, the total number of cans on Sunday is 10 bags * 4 cans/bag = 40 cans.

To find the total number of cans Kaleb picked up, we add the cans from Saturday and Sunday: 16 cans + 40 cans = 56 cans.

Therefore, Kaleb picked up a total of 56 cans.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is56 cans.

To find out how many shelves Jerry will need, we first need to determine how many books he has left after the librarian takes 7 of them.

Total books = 34
Books taken by librarian = 7

Books left with Jerry = Total books - Books taken by librarian
                      = 34 - 7

Now, since Jerry can fit 3 books on a shelf, we divide the number of books he has left by 3 to find out how many shelves he will need.

Shelves needed = Books left with Jerry / Books per shelf
               = 27 / 3
               = 9

To find out how much flour Isabel still needs, we can start by calculating the total amount of flour she used for the 3 brownies she baked. Since each brownie required 5 cups of flour, the total amount of flour used is 3 brownies * 5 cups/brownie = 15 cups of flour.

However, Isabel needed a total of 5 brownies for her party, and she has only baked 3 so far. Therefore, she still needs 5 brownies - 3 brownies = 2 more brownies.

Since each brownie requires 5 cups of flour, Isabel still needs 2 brownies * 5 cups/brownie = 10 cups of flour.

Therefore, Isabel still needs 10 cups of flour to reach the desired total of 5 brownies for her party.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is10 cups of flour.

Kaleb was selling his old games. He started out with 76 but sold 46 of them. He packed the rest up putting 5 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use?
To find out how many boxes Kaleb had to use, we need to determine the number of games he had left after selling 46 of them. 

Starting with 76 games and selling 46, we can subtract the number of games sold from the initial amount:

76 - 46 = 30

Kaleb had 30 games left. 

Since he packed 5 games into each box, we can divide the number of games left by 5 to find the number of boxes:

30 ÷ 5 = 6

Therefore, Kaleb had to use 6 boxes to pack up the remaining games.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

Gwen and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds, how many points did they earn?
To find out how many points Gwen and her friends earned, we need to calculate the total weight of the recycled paper and then divide it by 3 to determine the number of points.

Gwen recycled 5 pounds, and her friends recycled 13 pounds. So, the total weight of recycled paper is 5 + 13 = 18 pounds.

Now, we divide the total weight by 3 to find the number of points earned: 18 ÷ 3 = 6.

Therefore, Gwen and her friends earned a total of 6 points for recycling the paper.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

There were 11 friends playing a video game online when 5 players quit. If each player left had 5 lives, how many lives did they have total?
Initially, there were 11 friends playing the video game online. If each player had 5 lives, the total number of lives they had collectively was 11 * 5 = 55 lives.

However, 5 players quit the game. So, we need to subtract the lives of those players from the total. Since each player had 5 lives, the number of lives lost due to the players quitting is 5 * 5 = 25 lives.

To find the total number of lives remaining, we subtract the lives lost from the initial total: 55 - 25 = 30 lives.

Therefore, after 5 players quit, the remaining players have a total of 30 lives.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is30.

A pet shelter had 3 puppies when another 3 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, the pet shelter had 3 puppies.
Then, another 3 puppies were brought in.
So, the total number of puppies in the shelter is 3 + 3 = 6.

If 3 puppies are adopted each day, it means that the number of puppies decreases by 3 every day.

To find out how many days it will take for all the puppies to be adopted, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Total number of puppies = 6
Number of puppies adopted per day = 3

Number of days = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies adopted per day
Number of days = 6 / 3
Number of days = 2

Therefore, it will take 2 days for all the puppies to be adopted.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

At the fair Adam bought 13 tickets. After riding the ferris wheel he had 4 tickets left. If each ticket cost 9 dollars, how much money did Adam spend riding the ferris wheel?
To find out how much money Adam spent riding the ferris wheel, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets he used.

Adam initially had 13 tickets and ended up with 4 tickets after riding the ferris wheel. Therefore, he used 13 - 4 = 9 tickets for the ride.

Since each ticket costs $9, we can multiply the number of tickets used (9) by the cost per ticket ($9) to find the total cost.

Total cost = Number of tickets used × Cost per ticket
Total cost = 9 tickets × $9/ticket
Total cost = $81

Therefore, Adam spent $81 riding the ferris wheel.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$81.

A chef needs to cook 9 potatoes. He has already cooked 7. If each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?
To find out how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining potatoes, we need to determine how many potatoes are left to cook and then multiply that by the time it takes to cook each potato.

The chef needs to cook a total of 9 potatoes, and he has already cooked 7. Therefore, the number of potatoes left to cook is 9 - 7 = 2.

Since each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, we can multiply the number of potatoes left (2) by the time it takes to cook each potato (3 minutes):

2 potatoes * 3 minutes/potato = 6 minutes.

So, it will take the chef 6 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6 minutes.

To find the number of groups, we need to divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group.

The total number of players is the sum of the new players and the returning players:
Total players = 31 new players + 4 returning players = 35 players

Now, we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:
Number of groups = Total players / Players in each group

Number of groups = 35 players / 7 players per group = 5 groups

Therefore, there would be 5 groups in total.

Nancy initially had 80 files.
After deleting 31 files, she is left with 80 - 31 = 49 files.

Now, we divide the remaining 49 files by 7 to determine the number of folders:

To find out how many shelves Roger will need, we first need to determine how many books he has left after the librarian takes 2 of them.

Total books = 14
Books taken by librarian = 2

Books left with Roger = Total books - Books taken by librarian
Books left with Roger = 14 - 2
Books left with Roger = 12

Now, we need to calculate the number of shelves required to accommodate these 12 books. Since each shelf can hold 3 books, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf.

Number of shelves = Books left with Roger / Books per shelf
Number of shelves = 12 / 3
Number of shelves = 4

Therefore, Roger will need 4 shelves to put away the remaining 12 books.

Total flowers picked = 4 tulips + 11 roses = 15 flowers
Flowers used = 11 flowers

To find the number of extra flowers, we subtract the flowers used from the total flowers picked:
Extra flowers = Total flowers picked - Flowers used
Extra flowers = 15 flowers - 11 flowers
Extra flowers = 4 flowers

Therefore, Janet picked 4 extra flowers.

Given that there were 9 customers in total and 5 of them didn't leave a tip, we can determine that 9 - 5 = 4 customers did leave a tip.

Since each of the tipping customers gave $8, we can multiply the number of tipping customers by the tip amount to find the total earnings. Therefore, the waiter earned 4 * $8 = $32.

Hence, the waiter earned $32 in tips.

In fourth grade there were 11 students at the start of the year. During the year 6 students left and 42 new students came to school. How many students were in fourth grade at the end?
To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left during the year from the number of new students who joined.

Number of students at the start of the year = 11
Number of students who left during the year = 6
Number of new students who joined = 42

To find the number of students at the end of the year, we can subtract the number of students who left from the initial number of students and then add the number of new students:

Number of students at the end of the year = (Number of students at the start of the year - Number of students who left) + Number of new students
Number of students at the end of the year = (11 - 6) + 42
Number of students at the end of the year = 5 + 42
Number of students at the end of the year = 47

The cost of each flower is $6, and Katie bought 5 roses. So, the cost of the roses is 5 roses * $6/rose = $<<5*6=30>>30.

Similarly, Katie bought 5 daisies, and each daisy costs $6. Therefore, the cost of the daisies is 5 daisies * $6/daisy = $<<5*6=30>>30.

A trivia team had 14 members total, but during a game 7 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 5 points, how many points were scored total?
To find the total number of points scored, we need to determine the number of members who showed up and multiply it by the points each member scored.

Given that there were 14 members in total and 7 members didn't show up, we can calculate the number of members who did show up by subtracting the absent members from the total:

Members who showed up = Total members - Absent members
Members who showed up = 14 - 7
Members who showed up = 7

Now, we can multiply the number of members who showed up by the points each member scored:

Total points scored = Members who showed up * Points per member
Total points scored = 7 * 5
Total points scored = 35

Therefore, a total of 35 points were scored by the members who showed up.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is35.

At the arcade Dave won 25 tickets. If he spent 22 tickets on a beanie and later won 15 more tickets, how many would he have?
To solve this problem, we can start by subtracting the number of tickets Dave spent on the beanie from the number of tickets he initially won. 

Dave initially won 25 tickets and spent 22 tickets on a beanie, so we can subtract 22 from 25:

25 - 22 = 3

After purchasing the beanie, Dave had 3 tickets left. 

Later, Dave won an additional 15 tickets. To find out how many tickets he would have in total, we can add the number of tickets he had after purchasing the beanie to the number of tickets he won later:

3 + 15 = 18

Therefore, Dave would have a total of 18 tickets after spending 22 tickets on a beanie and winning an additional 15 tickets.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is18.

While playing a trivia game, George answered 6 questions correct in the first half and 4 questions correct in the second half. If each question was worth 3 points, what was his final score?
To find George's final score, we need to calculate the total number of questions he answered correctly and then multiply it by the points awarded per question.

In the first half, George answered 6 questions correctly, and in the second half, he answered 4 questions correctly. So, the total number of questions he answered correctly is 6 + 4 = 10.

Since each question is worth 3 points, we can multiply the total number of questions answered correctly by 3 to find George's final score: 10 * 3 = 30.

Therefore, George's final score is 30 points.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is30.

Edward bought 79 tickets at the state fair. He spent 23 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on rides. If each ride cost 7 tickets, how many rides could he go on?
To find out how many rides Edward can go on, we need to subtract the number of tickets he spent at the 'dunk a clown' booth from the total number of tickets he bought.

Total tickets bought: 79
Tickets spent at 'dunk a clown' booth: 23

Remaining tickets for rides: 79 - 23 = 56

Now, we can divide the remaining tickets by the number of tickets required for each ride to determine how many rides Edward can go on.

Number of rides Edward can go on: 56 / 7 = 8 rides

Therefore, Edward can go on 8 rides with the remaining tickets he has.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is8.

Oliver had 35 dollars. For his birthday he got 50 more dollars but spent 84 on a new game. How much money does he have now?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oliver initially had $35.
2. He received an additional $50 for his birthday.
3. However, he spent $84 on a new game.

To find out how much money Oliver has now, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had after receiving the birthday money.

Total amount after receiving birthday money: $35 + $50 = $85

Amount remaining after spending on the new game: $85 - $84 = $1

Therefore, Oliver now has $1 left after receiving the birthday money and spending on the new game.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$1.

Roger was putting his spare change into piles. He had 3 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. If each pile had 7 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?
To find the total number of coins Roger had, we need to calculate the number of quarters and dimes separately, and then add them together.

Number of quarters:
Since Roger had 3 piles of quarters, and each pile had 7 coins, we can multiply the number of piles by the number of coins in each pile:
3 piles * 7 coins/pile = 21 quarters

Number of dimes:
Similarly, Roger had 3 piles of dimes, with 7 coins in each pile:
3 piles * 7 coins/pile = 21 dimes

Total number of coins:
To find the total, we add the number of quarters and dimes together:
21 quarters + 21 dimes = 42 coins

Therefore, Roger had a total of 42 coins.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is42.

John made 6 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 3 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
To determine how long the money would last John, we need to calculate his total earnings and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

John earned $6 mowing lawns and $18 weed eating, so his total earnings are $6 + $18 = $24.

Since John spends $3 per week, we can divide his total earnings ($24) by his weekly expenses ($3) to find out how many weeks the money would last him.

$24 / $3 = 8

Therefore, the money would last John for 8 weeks.

To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out.

Total number of students who tried out = 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students

Number of students who got called back = 26

Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students who tried out - Number of students who got called back
                                               = 43 - 26

In this scenario, we have 15 people in total, out of which 8 are kids. Since kids eat for free, we only need to consider the cost for the adult meals.

The cost of each adult meal is $5. As there are 15 people in total and 8 of them are kids, the number of adults in the group would be 15 - 8 = 7.

To calculate the total cost for the group to eat, we multiply the number of adults by the cost of each adult meal:

Total cost = Number of adults × Cost per adult meal
Total cost = 7 × $5
Total cost = $35

Therefore, it would cost $35 for the group of 15 people to eat at the restaurant.

Oliver had 33 dollars in January. By March he had spent 4 dollars. If he got another 32 dollars from his mom, how much money would he have?
To find out how much money Oliver would have, we need to add up the amounts he had in January, the amount he spent in March, and the amount he received from his mom. 

Oliver had 33 dollars in January. He spent 4 dollars in March, so he would have 33 - 4 = 29 dollars left.

If he received an additional 32 dollars from his mom, we can add that to the amount he had left: 29 + 32 = 61 dollars.

Therefore, Oliver would have 61 dollars after receiving the money from his mom.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is61.

At the arcade Victor won 46 tickets. If he spent 27 tickets on a beanie and later won 39 more tickets, how many would he have?
To solve this problem, we can start by subtracting the number of tickets Victor spent on the beanie from the number of tickets he initially won. 

Initial number of tickets won: 46
Tickets spent on a beanie: 27

46 - 27 = 19

After spending 27 tickets on the beanie, Victor would have 19 tickets left. 

Next, we can add the additional 39 tickets that Victor won later to find out how many tickets he would have in total.

19 + 39 = 58

Therefore, Victor would have a total of 58 tickets after spending 27 tickets on a beanie and winning an additional 39 tickets.

A group of 3 friends went into a restaurant. The chef already had 8 chicken wings cooked but cooked 10 more for the group. If they each got the same amount how many would each person get?
To find out how many chicken wings each person would get, we need to divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of people in the group. 

The chef initially had 8 chicken wings cooked, and then cooked an additional 10, resulting in a total of 8 + 10 = 18 chicken wings.

Since there are 3 friends in the group, we divide the total number of chicken wings (18) by the number of people (3):

18 ÷ 3 = 6

Therefore, each person would get 6 chicken wings.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to determine the number of remaining clothes after the first load.

Luke initially put 17 pieces of clothing in the first load, so the number of clothes left to be split into 5 equal loads is 47 - 17 = 30.

Now, we can divide the remaining clothes equally among the 5 small loads:

30 ÷ 5 = 6.

Therefore, each of the small loads can contain 6 pieces of clothing.

A pet store has 4 bird cages. If each cage has 8 parrots and 2 parakeets in it, how many birds does the pet store have total?
To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we need to multiply the number of cages by the number of birds in each cage.

Number of cages: 4
Number of parrots in each cage: 8
Number of parakeets in each cage: 2

Total number of birds in each cage: 8 + 2 = 10

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds in the pet store by multiplying the number of cages by the number of birds in each cage:

Total number of birds = Number of cages × Total number of birds in each cage
Total number of birds = 4 × 10
Total number of birds = 40

Therefore, the pet store has a total of 40 birds.

To find out how many packages Isabel could make, we need to determine the number of cupcakes she has left after her brother ate some. 

Isabel initially baked 39 cupcakes, and her brother ate 21 of them. Therefore, the number of cupcakes remaining is:

39 - 21 = 18 cupcakes

Now, we can calculate the number of packages she can make by dividing the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package:

18 cupcakes ÷ 3 cupcakes/package = 6 packages

So, Isabel can make 6 packages with the remaining 18 cupcakes.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

Total number of siamese cats = 36
Total number of house cats = 18

Total number of cats initially = 36 + 18 = 54

Number of cats sold = 26

Number of cats left = Total number of cats initially - Number of cats sold
                     = 54 - 26

Katie had 7 pages of math homework, and each page had 9 problems. So, the total number of math problems is 7 pages × 9 problems/page = 63 problems.

Similarly, Katie had 3 pages of reading homework, and each page had 9 problems. Therefore, the total number of reading problems is 3 pages × 9 problems/page = 27 problems.

To find the total number of problems, we add the number of math problems and reading problems: 63 problems + 27 problems = 90 problems.

Therefore, Katie had a total of 90 problems to complete.

To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out.

The total number of students who tried out is the sum of the number of girls and boys:
Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of students = 30 girls + 36 boys
Total number of students = 66

Now, we subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students:
Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students - Number of students called back
Number of students who didn't make the cut = 66 - 10
Number of students who didn't make the cut = 56

Therefore, 56 students didn't make the cut for the school's basketball team.

The builder had already installed 6 windows, and the total number of windows needed is 10. Therefore, the number of windows left to be installed is 10 - 6 = 4.

Since it takes 5 hours to install each window, we can multiply the number of remaining windows (4) by the time it takes to install each window (5 hours) to find the total time needed.

4 windows * 5 hours/window = 20 hours

Therefore, it will take the builder 20 hours to install the remaining windows.

The total number of sodas Jerry bought is 41 regular sodas + 22 diet sodas = 63 sodas.

Since the fridge can hold 9 sodas on each shelf, we divide the total number of sodas by 9 to find the number of shelves needed.

63 sodas ÷ 9 sodas per shelf = 7 shelves.

Therefore, Jerry would need to fill up 7 shelves in his fridge to accommodate all the sodas for the birthday party.

Total number of short sleeve shirts = 39
Total number of long sleeve shirts = 47

Total number of shirts Oliver had to wash = 39 + 47 = 86

Number of shirts Oliver washed = 20

Number of shirts Oliver did not wash = Total number of shirts - Number of shirts washed

April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 3 dollars. If Zoe bought 8 roses and 2 daisies, how much did she spend?
To find out how much Zoe spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and daisies separately, and then add them together.

The cost of each rose is $3, and Zoe bought 8 roses. So, the total cost of the roses is 8 * $3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.

Similarly, the cost of each daisy is also $3, and Zoe bought 2 daisies. Therefore, the total cost of the daisies is 2 * $3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.

To find the total amount Zoe spent, we add the cost of the roses and the daisies: $24 + $6 = $<<24+6=30>>30.

Therefore, Zoe spent $30 on 8 roses and 2 daisies from April's discount flowers.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isZoe spent $30 on 8 roses and 2 daisies from April's discount flowers.

Oliver was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 2 new cards and 10 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?
To determine the number of pages Oliver would use, we need to calculate the total number of cards he has and divide it by the number of cards per page.

Oliver has 2 new cards and 10 old cards, which gives a total of 2 + 10 = 12 cards.

Since there are 3 cards on each page, we divide the total number of cards by 3 to find the number of pages Oliver would use.

12 cards ÷ 3 cards per page = 4 pages

Therefore, Oliver would use 4 pages to organize his baseball cards in the binder.

At the fair Kaleb bought 6 tickets. After riding the ferris wheel he had 3 tickets left. If each ticket cost 9 dollars, how much money did Kaleb spend riding the ferris wheel?
To find out how much money Kaleb spent riding the ferris wheel, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets he used.

Kaleb initially had 6 tickets and had 3 tickets left after riding the ferris wheel. This means he used 6 - 3 = 3 tickets for the ride.

Since each ticket costs $9, we can multiply the number of tickets used (3) by the cost per ticket ($9) to find the total cost.

Total cost = Number of tickets used × Cost per ticket
Total cost = 3 × $9
Total cost = $27

Therefore, Kaleb spent $27 riding the ferris wheel.

A painter needed to paint 10 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 8 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the remaining rooms, we need to calculate the total time it takes to paint all the rooms and subtract the time already spent.

The painter has already painted 8 rooms, and each room takes 8 hours to paint. So, the total time spent painting the 8 rooms is 8 rooms * 8 hours/room = 64 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time it takes to paint all 10 rooms. Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, the total time required to paint all 10 rooms is 10 rooms * 8 hours/room = 80 hours.

To find out how much longer the painter will take, we subtract the time already spent from the total time required: 80 hours - 64 hours = 16 hours.

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 16 hours to paint the remaining 2 rooms.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is16 hours.

At lunch a waiter had 7 customers and 5 of them didn't leave a tip. If he got $3 each from the ones who did tip, how much money did he earn?
To calculate the amount of money the waiter earned, we need to determine the number of customers who left a tip and multiply it by the tip amount.

Given that there were 7 customers in total and 5 of them didn't leave a tip, we can find the number of customers who did tip by subtracting the non-tippers from the total number of customers:

Number of customers who tipped = Total customers - Non-tippers
Number of customers who tipped = 7 - 5
Number of customers who tipped = 2

Since each customer who tipped gave $3, we can multiply the number of customers who tipped by the tip amount to find the total earnings:

Total earnings = Number of customers who tipped * Tip amount
Total earnings = 2 * $3
Total earnings = $6

Therefore, the waiter earned $6 in total.

To find the number of players on Paige's team, we can subtract Paige's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the score of each player (6 points). 

Let's denote the number of players on Paige's team as 'x'. 

The total score is 41 points, and Paige scored 11 points. So, the remaining points scored by the other players would be 41 - 11 = 30 points. 

Since each player, apart from Paige, scored 6 points, we can set up the equation:

6(x - 1) = 30

Simplifying the equation:

6x - 6 = 30

Adding 6 to both sides:

6x = 36

Dividing both sides by 6:

Roger earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 14 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them, how much money did he actually earn?
To find out how much money Roger actually earned, we need to calculate the number of lawns he mowed and multiply it by the amount he earned per lawn.

Roger had 14 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 8 of them. So, the number of lawns he actually mowed is 14 - 8 = 6.

Now, we can calculate the amount of money he earned by multiplying the number of lawns mowed (6) by the amount earned per lawn ($9):

Money earned = Number of lawns mowed × Amount earned per lawn
Money earned = 6 × $9
Money earned = $54

Therefore, Roger actually earned $54.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$54.

Robin had 30 songs on her mp3 player. If she deleted 8 old songs from it and then added 10 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player?
To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of songs Robin deleted from the number of songs she had initially, and then add the number of new songs she added.

Initial number of songs = 30
Number of songs deleted = 8
Number of songs added = 10

To find the total number of songs on her mp3 player, we can calculate:

Total number of songs = Initial number of songs - Number of songs deleted + Number of songs added

Total number of songs = 30 - 8 + 10
Total number of songs = 22 + 10
Total number of songs = 32

Therefore, Robin has 32 songs on her mp3 player after deleting 8 old songs and adding 10 new songs.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is32.

To find out how much money Henry actually earned, we need to calculate the number of lawns he mowed and multiply it by the amount he earned per lawn.

Henry had 12 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 7 of them. Therefore, he actually mowed 12 - 7 = 5 lawns.

Since Henry earned 5 dollars for each lawn he mowed, we can multiply the number of lawns he mowed by the amount he earned per lawn: 5 lawns * $5/lawn = $<<5*5=25>>25.

So, Henry actually earned $25.

There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 3 players quit. If each player left had 3 lives, how many lives did they have total?
Initially, there were 8 friends playing the video game online. Each player had 3 lives, so the total number of lives at the beginning was 8 players × 3 lives/player = 24 lives.

However, 3 players quit the game. So, we need to subtract the lives of those who left. Since each player had 3 lives, the number of lives lost is 3 players × 3 lives/player = 9 lives.

To find the total number of lives remaining, we subtract the lives lost from the initial total: 24 lives - 9 lives = 15 lives.

Therefore, after 3 players quit, the remaining players have a total of 15 lives.

To solve this problem, we can start by finding the total number of chocolate pieces in the 7 boxes. Since each box contains 4 pieces, we can multiply 7 by 4:

7 boxes * 4 pieces/box = 28 pieces

So, initially, Will had 28 pieces of chocolate candy. However, he gave 3 boxes to his little brother, which means he gave away 3 * 4 = 12 pieces.

To find out how many pieces Will still has, we subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the initial total:

28 pieces - 12 pieces = 16 pieces

Therefore, Will still has 16 pieces of chocolate candy.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is16.

Candy boxes of chocolate: 7 boxes
Pieces of chocolate candy per box: 8 pieces
Total chocolate candy pieces: 7 boxes * 8 pieces/box = 56 pieces

Candy boxes of caramel: 3 boxes
Pieces of caramel candy per box: 8 pieces
Total caramel candy pieces: 3 boxes * 8 pieces/box = 24 pieces

Now, to find the total candy pieces, we add the chocolate and caramel candy pieces together:
Total candy pieces = Chocolate candy pieces + Caramel candy pieces
Total candy pieces = 56 pieces + 24 pieces = 80 pieces

Therefore, Cody had a total of 80 pieces of candy.

The total number of sodas Tom bought is 4 regular sodas + 52 diet sodas = 56 sodas.

Since each shelf can hold 7 sodas, we divide the total number of sodas by 7 to find the number of shelves needed.

56 sodas ÷ 7 sodas per shelf = 8 shelves.

Therefore, Tom would need to fill up 8 shelves to store all the sodas for the birthday party.

To find the total number of songs Janet bought, we need to calculate the number of songs in the country albums and the pop albums separately, and then add them together.

Number of songs in the country albums:
Since Janet bought 6 country albums, and each album has 9 songs, we can multiply the number of albums by the number of songs per album:
6 country albums * 9 songs per album = 54 country songs

Number of songs in the pop albums:
Janet bought 2 pop albums, and each album has 9 songs, so we can multiply the number of albums by the number of songs per album:
2 pop albums * 9 songs per album = 18 pop songs

Total number of songs Janet bought:
To find the total number of songs, we add the number of country songs and the number of pop songs:

To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students.

Total number of students = 25
Number of students who didn't get picked = 15

To find the number of students who did get picked, we subtract the number of students who didn't get picked from the total number of students:

Number of students who got picked = Total number of students - Number of students who didn't get picked
Number of students who got picked = 25 - 15
Number of students who got picked = 10

Now, since the remaining students who got picked were divided into 2 groups, we divide the number of students who got picked by 2 to find out how many students would be in each group:

Number of students in each group = Number of students who got picked / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = 10 / 2
Number of students in each group = 5

Luke was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 3 new cards and 9 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?
To determine the number of pages Luke would use, we need to calculate the total number of cards he has and divide it by the number of cards per page.

Luke has 3 new cards and 9 old cards, which gives a total of 3 + 9 = 12 cards.

Since there are 3 cards on each page, we divide the total number of cards by 3 to find the number of pages: 12 / 3 = 4.

Therefore, Luke would use 4 pages to organize his baseball cards in the binder.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is4.

Will made 104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 41 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 9 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
To find out how many 9-dollar games Will can buy with the money he had left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on mower blades from the total amount he made.

Total amount Will made: $104
Amount spent on mower blades: $41

Money left after buying mower blades: $104 - $41 = $63

Now, we can divide the money left by the cost of each game to determine how many games he can buy:

Number of 9-dollar games = $63 / $9 = 7

Therefore, Will can buy 7 nine-dollar games with the money he had left after buying the mower blades.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is7.

Maria was making baggies of cookies with 3 cookies in each bag. If she had 2 chocolate chip cookies and 16 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?
To determine how many baggies Maria can make, we need to find the total number of cookies she has and divide it by the number of cookies in each bag.

Maria has 2 chocolate chip cookies and 16 oatmeal cookies, which gives a total of 2 + 16 = 18 cookies.

Since each bag contains 3 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies (18) by the number of cookies in each bag (3):

18 cookies ÷ 3 cookies/bag = 6 baggies

Therefore, Maria can make 6 baggies of cookies.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

Dave was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 6 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 6 hours and on Tuesday he worked 2 hours. How much money did Dave make in those two days?
To calculate the amount of money Dave made in those two days, we need to find the total earnings for each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Dave worked 6 hours and earned 6 dollars per hour. So, his earnings for Monday can be calculated as:
6 hours * 6 dollars/hour = 36 dollars

On Tuesday, Dave worked 2 hours and earned 6 dollars per hour. Therefore, his earnings for Tuesday can be calculated as:
2 hours * 6 dollars/hour = 12 dollars

To find the total earnings for both days, we add Monday's earnings to Tuesday's earnings:
36 dollars + 12 dollars = 48 dollars

Therefore, Dave made a total of 48 dollars in those two days.

At a restaurant each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free. If a group of 9 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
In this scenario, we have 9 people in total, with 2 of them being kids. Since kids eat for free, we only need to consider the cost for the adult meals.

The cost of each adult meal is $2. Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat would be the number of adults multiplied by the cost per adult meal.

Number of adults = Total number of people - Number of kids
Number of adults = 9 - 2 = 7

Total cost for the group to eat = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal
Total cost for the group to eat = 7 * $2 = $14

Hence, it would cost $14 for the group of 9 people, including 2 kids, to eat at the restaurant.

Luke started with 57 games and sold 39, so the number of games he had left is:
57 - 39 = 18 games

Since Luke packed 2 games into each box, we can divide the number of games he had left by 2 to find the number of boxes:

In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 3 points. If a level has 6 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn?
To calculate the number of points earned, we need to find the number of enemies defeated and multiply it by the points awarded per enemy. In this case, each enemy defeated gives you 3 points.

Given that there are 6 enemies in total and you destroy all but 2 of them, we can find the number of enemies defeated by subtracting the remaining enemies from the total number of enemies:

Number of enemies defeated = Total enemies - Remaining enemies
Number of enemies defeated = 6 - 2
Number of enemies defeated = 4

Now, we can calculate the points earned by multiplying the number of enemies defeated by the points awarded per enemy:

Points earned = Number of enemies defeated * Points per enemy
Points earned = 4 * 3
Points earned = 12

Therefore, you would earn 12 points by defeating all but 2 enemies in the level.

6 cups/brownie * 7 brownies = 42 cups of flour

So far, Chloe has used 42 cups of flour. However, she needs a total of 16 brownies for her party. To determine how many more cups of flour she needs, we subtract the amount she has already used from the total amount needed:

Total cups of flour needed - Cups of flour used = Cups of flour still needed

Therefore, the players had a total of 24 lives.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is24.

Debby had 30 coloring books. If she gave away 7 of them, but then bought 35 more, how many would she have total?
To solve this problem, we'll start with the initial number of coloring books Debby had, which is 30. 

If she gave away 7 coloring books, we subtract that from the initial number: 30 - 7 = 23.

After giving away 7 coloring books, Debby bought 35 more. To find the total number of coloring books she would have, we add the number she had after giving away 7 (23) to the number she bought (35): 23 + 35 = 58.

Therefore, Debby would have a total of 58 coloring books.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is58.

A chef needs to cook 16 potatoes. He has already cooked 7. If each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?
To find out how long it will take the chef to cook the remaining potatoes, we need to determine how many potatoes are left to cook and then multiply that number by the time it takes to cook each potato.

The chef needs to cook a total of 16 potatoes, and he has already cooked 7. Therefore, the number of potatoes left to cook is 16 - 7 = 9.

Since each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, we can multiply the number of potatoes left (9) by the time it takes to cook each potato (5 minutes):

9 potatoes * 5 minutes/potato = 45 minutes

So, it will take the chef 45 minutes to cook the remaining 9 potatoes.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is45 minutes.

To find out how long the candy will last Emily, we need to determine the total number of candy pieces she received and divide it by the number of pieces she eats per day.

Emily received 5 pieces of candy from neighbors and 13 pieces from her sister, so the total number of candy pieces is 5 + 13 = 18.

If Emily eats 9 pieces of candy per day, we can divide the total number of candy pieces (18) by the number of pieces she eats per day (9):

18 / 9 = 2

Therefore, the candy will last Emily for 2 days.

At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free. If a group of 11 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
To calculate the total cost for the group to eat, we need to determine the number of adults in the group. Since the problem states that each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat for free, we can subtract the number of kids from the total number of people to find the number of adults.

Total number of people - Number of kids = Number of adults
11 - 2 = 9 adults

Now that we know there are 9 adults in the group, we can calculate the cost for the group to eat by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per adult meal.

Cost per adult meal * Number of adults = Total cost for the group to eat
$8 * 9 = $72

Therefore, it would cost $72 for the group of 11 people, including 2 kids, to eat at the restaurant.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$72.

Roger was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
To determine the number of trips Roger will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays he needs to pick up and divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

From one table, Roger needs to pick up 10 trays, and from another table, he needs to pick up 2 trays. So, the total number of trays he needs to pick up is 10 + 2 = 12 trays.

Since Roger can carry 4 trays at a time, we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip: 12 trays ÷ 4 trays/trip = 3 trips.

Therefore, Roger will make 3 trips to pick up all the trays.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3 trips.

Adam had 12 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 8 of them. So, the number of lawns he actually mowed is 12 - 8 = 4.

Now, we can calculate the amount of money he earned by multiplying the number of lawns mowed (4) by the amount earned per lawn ($9):

4 lawns * $9/lawn = $<<4*9=36>>36.

Therefore, Adam actually earned $36.

The school cafeteria ordered 25 red apples and 17 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 10 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

The cafeteria ordered 25 red apples and 17 green apples, so the total number of apples ordered is 25 + 17 = 42 apples.

However, only 10 students wanted fruit. Let's assume all 10 students wanted both red and green apples. So, the total number of apples the students wanted is 10 + 10 = 20 apples.

To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered: 42 - 20 = 22.

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 22 extra apples.

To find out how much money Zoe would have made, we need to calculate the number of bars she sold and then multiply that by the cost per bar.

The total number of bars in the box is 13, and Zoe sold all but 6 bars. So, the number of bars she sold is 13 - 6 = 7 bars.

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Zoe made by multiplying the number of bars sold by the cost per bar. Each bar costs $6, so 7 bars would cost 7 * $6 = $<<7*6=42>>42.

Therefore, Zoe would have made $42 by selling all but 6 bars from the box.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$42.

At the arcade Dave won 11 tickets. If he spent 5 tickets on a beanie and later won 10 more tickets, how many would he have?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Dave initially won 11 tickets.
He then spent 5 tickets on a beanie, which means he now has 11 - 5 = 6 tickets left.
Afterward, Dave won an additional 10 tickets.
To find out how many tickets he would have in total, we add the tickets he had left (6) to the tickets he won (10): 6 + 10 = 16.

Therefore, Dave would have a total of 16 tickets after spending 5 tickets on a beanie and winning an additional 10 tickets.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is16.

Tom bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 7 to his little brother. If each box has 6 pieces inside it, how many pieces did Tom still have?
To solve this problem, we'll start by finding out how many boxes of chocolate candy Tom has left after giving 7 to his little brother.

Tom initially had 12 boxes of chocolate candy.
He gave 7 boxes to his little brother.
Therefore, Tom has 12 - 7 = 5 boxes of chocolate candy left.

Now, we need to determine the total number of pieces of chocolate candy Tom has left. Since each box contains 6 pieces, we'll multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces in each box.

Tom has 5 boxes of chocolate candy left.
Each box contains 6 pieces.
So, Tom has 5 * 6 = 30 pieces of chocolate candy left.

Therefore, Tom still has 30 pieces of chocolate candy after giving 7 boxes to his little brother.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is30.

A waiter had 44 customers in his section. If 12 of them left and the rest of his tables had 8 people at each table, how many tables did he have?
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The waiter initially had 44 customers in his section.
2. 12 of them left, so we subtract 12 from the initial number of customers: 44 - 12 = 32 customers remaining.
3. The remaining customers were seated at tables with 8 people at each table.
4. To find the number of tables, we divide the total number of customers by the number of people at each table: 32 / 8 = 4 tables.

Therefore, the waiter had 4 tables in his section.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is4 tables.

At the schools book fair Victor bought 32 adventure books and 37 mystery books. If 16 of the books were used, how many new books did he buy?
To find out how many new books Victor bought, we need to subtract the number of used books from the total number of books he bought.

Total number of books bought = Number of adventure books + Number of mystery books
Total number of books bought = 32 adventure books + 37 mystery books
Total number of books bought = 69 books

Now, let's subtract the number of used books from the total number of books bought:

Number of new books = Total number of books bought - Number of used books
Number of new books = 69 books - 16 used books
Number of new books = 53 new books

Therefore, Victor bought 53 new books.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is53.

The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of red apples ordered: 42
Total number of green apples ordered: 7

Total number of apples ordered: 42 + 7 = 49

Number of apples the students wanted: 9

Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples the students wanted
Extra apples = 49 - 9 = 40

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 40 extra apples.

Zoe baked 5 brownies, but needed 11 total for her party. If she used 7 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?
To find out how many more cups of flour Zoe needs, we can subtract the number of brownies she already baked from the total number of brownies she needs for her party.

Zoe baked 5 brownies, and she needs 11 in total. So, she still needs 11 - 5 = 6 more brownies.

Since she uses 7 cups of flour for each brownie, we can multiply the number of remaining brownies by the amount of flour used per brownie to find out how much flour she still needs. 

6 remaining brownies * 7 cups of flour per brownie = 42 cups of flour

Therefore, Zoe still needs 42 cups of flour for her party.

Victor was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 6 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 5 hours and on Tuesday he worked 5 hours. How much money did Victor make in those two days?
To calculate the amount of money Victor made in those two days, we need to find the total number of hours he worked and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

On Monday, Victor worked for 5 hours, and on Tuesday, he also worked for 5 hours. So, the total number of hours worked is 5 + 5 = 10 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Victor made by multiplying the total number of hours (10) by his hourly wage ($6):

Total money = Total hours worked × Hourly wage
Total money = 10 hours × $6
Total money = $60

Therefore, Victor made $60 in those two days.

A painter needed to paint 9 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 5 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the remaining rooms, we need to calculate the total time it takes to paint all the rooms and subtract the time already spent.

The painter has already painted 5 rooms, and each room takes 8 hours to paint. So, the total time spent painting the 5 rooms is 5 rooms * 8 hours/room = 40 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time it takes to paint all 9 rooms. Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, the total time required to paint all 9 rooms is 9 rooms * 8 hours/room = 72 hours.

To find out how much longer the painter will take, we subtract the time already spent from the total time required: 72 hours - 40 hours = 32 hours.

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 32 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is32 hours.

2. Out of these 22 customers, 14 of them left.
3. Therefore, the number of customers remaining in the section is 22 - 14 = 8.

Now, we know that the remaining customers are seated at tables with 4 people at each table. To find the number of tables, we can divide the total number of customers by the number of people at each table:

Number of tables = Number of customers / Number of people per table
Number of tables = 8 / 4 = 2

Hence, the waiter has 2 tables in his section.

Since her washing machine can only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time, we divide the total number of clothing items by the machine's capacity: 27 ÷ 9 = 3.

Therefore, Nancy would have to do 3 loads of laundry to wash all 27 clothing items.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

Sarah had 60 homework problems. She finished 20 of them but still had 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Sarah has already finished from the total number of problems she had initially.

Total number of problems - Problems already finished = Problems left to do

60 - 20 = 40

So, Sarah still has 40 problems left to do. 

Since she has 5 pages of problems left, we can divide the number of problems left by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page.

Problems left to do ÷ Number of pages = Problems on each page

40 ÷ 5 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 problems on each page.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is8.

A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 39 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 12 customers. If 49 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?
To find out how many customers left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. 

The waiter initially had 39 customers, and during the lunch rush, he added another 12 customers. So the total number of customers he had to serve is 39 + 12 = 51.

Out of these 51 customers, 49 didn't leave a tip. To find the number of customers who did leave a tip, we subtract 49 from 51:

51 - 49 = 2

Therefore, 2 customers left a tip.

A group of 3 friends went into a restaurant. The chef already had 6 chicken wings cooked but cooked 3 more for the group. If they each got the same amount how many would each person get?
To find out how many chicken wings each person would get, we need to divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of people in the group. 

The chef initially had 6 chicken wings cooked, and then cooked 3 more, resulting in a total of 6 + 3 = 9 chicken wings.

Since there are 3 friends in the group, we divide the total number of chicken wings (9) by the number of people (3):

9 chicken wings ÷ 3 people = 3 chicken wings per person.

Therefore, each person would get 3 chicken wings.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the remaining rooms, we need to calculate the total time it takes to paint all the rooms and subtract the time already spent.

The painter has already painted 2 rooms, so he has 6 - 2 = 4 rooms left to paint.
Since each room takes 5 hours to paint, the total time needed to paint all the rooms is 4 rooms * 5 hours/room = 20 hours.

Now, we subtract the time already spent (2 rooms * 5 hours/room = 10 hours) from the total time needed:
20 hours - 10 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 10 hours to paint the remaining rooms.

To determine the number of tables needed, we need to find out how many people actually attended the luncheon. 

Given that 18 people were invited and 12 didn't show up, we can calculate the number of people who did attend by subtracting the number of no-shows from the total number of invitees:

Number of people who attended = Total number of invitees - Number of no-shows
Number of people who attended = 18 - 12
Number of people who attended = 6

Since each table can hold 3 people, we divide the number of people who attended by the capacity of each table to find the number of tables needed:

Number of tables needed = Number of people who attended / Capacity of each table
Number of tables needed = 6 / 3
Number of tables needed = 2

Gwen was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 4 books on it. If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 3 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
To find the total number of books Gwen had, we need to calculate the number of books on each type of shelf and then add them together.

For the mystery books:
Number of shelves = 5
Number of books per shelf = 4
Total number of mystery books = 5 shelves * 4 books per shelf = 20 books

For the picture books:
Number of shelves = 3
Number of books per shelf = 4
Total number of picture books = 3 shelves * 4 books per shelf = 12 books

To find the total number of books, we add the number of mystery books and picture books together:
Total number of books = Total number of mystery books + Total number of picture books
Total number of books = 20 books + 12 books = 32 books

Therefore, Gwen had a total of 32 books in her bookcase.

A store had 40 oranges in a bin. If they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin?
To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges in the bin, and then add the number of new oranges added.

Initial number of oranges in the bin = 40
Oranges thrown away = 25
New oranges added = 21

To find the final number of oranges in the bin, we can use the following equation:

Final number of oranges = Initial number of oranges - Oranges thrown away + New oranges added

Final number of oranges = 40 - 25 + 21

Calculating this, we get:

Final number of oranges = 40 - 25 + 21
Final number of oranges = 40 - 4
Final number of oranges = 36

Therefore, there would be 36 oranges in the bin after throwing away 25 old ones and adding 21 new ones.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is36.

From the first table, Dave needs to pick up 17 trays.
From the second table, Dave needs to pick up 55 trays.

The total number of trays Dave needs to carry is 17 + 55 = 72 trays.

Since Dave can only carry 9 trays at a time, we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip:

72 trays ÷ 9 trays/trip = 8 trips

The chef needs to cook a total of 13 potatoes, and he has already cooked 5. Therefore, the number of potatoes left to cook is 13 - 5 = 8.

Since each potato takes 6 minutes to cook, we can multiply the number of potatoes left (8) by the time it takes to cook each potato (6 minutes):

8 potatoes * 6 minutes/potato = 48 minutes.

So, it will take the chef 48 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes.

Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
To find the number of players on Bianca's team, we need to determine how many players scored 6 points each and add Bianca to that count.

Let's assume there are "x" players, excluding Bianca, who scored 6 points each. Since Bianca scored 45 points, the total points scored by the other players would be 75 - 45 = 30 points.

Since each player scored 6 points, the number of players scoring 6 points each can be calculated by dividing the total points scored by the other players (30) by the points scored by each player (6). Therefore, x = 30 / 6 = 5.

So, there are 5 players, excluding Bianca, who scored 6 points each. Adding Bianca to this count, the total number of players on her team is 5 + 1 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 players on Bianca's team.

Adam bought 13 boxes of chocolate candy.
He gave 7 boxes to his little brother.

So, the number of boxes Adam still had is 13 - 7 = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 6 pieces of chocolate candy, we can multiply the number of boxes Adam still had by the number of pieces in each box to find the total number of pieces he had left.

6 boxes * 6 pieces per box = 36 pieces

Therefore, Adam still had 36 pieces of chocolate candy.

To find out how many bouquets Paige can still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked.

Total flowers picked = 53
Wilted flowers = 18

To find the number of flowers that are not wilted, we subtract the wilted flowers from the total flowers picked:

Number of flowers not wilted = Total flowers picked - Wilted flowers
Number of flowers not wilted = 53 - 18
Number of flowers not wilted = 35

Now, we can determine the number of bouquets Paige can make by dividing the number of flowers not wilted by the number of flowers in each bouquet:

Number of bouquets = Number of flowers not wilted / Flowers in each bouquet
Number of bouquets = 35 / 7
Number of bouquets = 5

Therefore, Paige can still make 5 bouquets for her friend's wedding.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Start with the initial number of puppies in the shelter: 8.
2. Add the number of puppies brought in: 8 + 19 = 27.
3. Determine the number of puppies adopted per day: 3.
4. Divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day to find the number of days it would take for all of them to be adopted: 27 / 3 = 9.

Therefore, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is9.

The schools debate team had 5 boys and 40 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 9 how many groups could they make?
To determine the number of groups that can be formed, we need to find the total number of students and divide it by the group size.

The number of boys on the debate team is 5, and the number of girls is 40. So, the total number of students is 5 + 40 = 45.

Now, we divide the total number of students by the group size, which is 9.

45 ÷ 9 = 5

Therefore, they can form 5 groups of 9 students each.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is5.

Katie's team won their dodgeball game and scored 12 points total. If Katie scored 4 of the points and everyone else scored 4 points each, how many players were on her team?
To find the number of players on Katie's team, we can start by subtracting the points Katie scored from the total points scored by the team. 

If Katie scored 4 points and everyone else scored 4 points each, the total points scored by everyone else would be 4 * (number of players - 1). 

So, the equation becomes: 

12 - 4 = 4 * (number of players - 1)

Simplifying this equation, we have: 

8 = 4 * (number of players - 1)

Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get: 

2 = number of players - 1

Adding 1 to both sides of the equation, we find: 

number of players = 2 + 1

Therefore, there were 3 players on Katie's team.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

Mike made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 26 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 5 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?
To determine how long the money will last Mike, we need to calculate his total earnings and then divide it by his weekly expenses.

Mike earned $14 mowing lawns and $26 weed eating, so his total earnings are $14 + $26 = $40.

If he spends $5 per week, we can divide his total earnings ($40) by his weekly expenses ($5) to find out how many weeks the money will last.

$40 ÷ $5 = 8

Therefore, the money will last Mike for 8 weeks.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is8.

Henry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
To find out how many trips Henry will make, we need to determine the total number of trays he needs to carry and divide it by the number of trays he can carry in one trip.

From the first table, Henry needs to pick up 29 trays.
From the second table, Henry needs to pick up 52 trays.

The total number of trays is 29 + 52 = 81 trays.

Since Henry can only carry 9 trays at a time, we divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip:

81 trays ÷ 9 trays/trip = 9 trips.

Therefore, Henry will need to make 9 trips to pick up all the trays.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is9 trips.

To determine how many 8-dollar toys Frank can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy.

Frank has 3 dollars saved up and receives an additional 37 dollars for his allowance, giving him a total of 3 + 37 = 40 dollars.

Now, we divide the total amount of money Frank has (40 dollars) by the cost of each toy (8 dollars):

40 dollars ÷ 8 dollars/toy = 5 toys

Therefore, Frank can buy 5 eight-dollar toys with the money he has.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is5.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many files Wendy had left after deleting 37 of them. 

Wendy initially had 82 files, and she deleted 37 of them. Therefore, the number of files she had left is:

82 - 37 = 45 files

Now, we need to determine how many folders Wendy can create with 5 files in each one. To do this, we divide the total number of files by the number of files in each folder:

45 ÷ 5 = 9

So, Wendy ended up with 9 folders.

Roger had 68 dollars. If he spent 47 bucks on a new game, how many 7 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left?
To find out how many 7-dollar toys Roger can buy with the money he has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the new game from the total amount he had initially.

Total amount Roger had = $68
Amount spent on the new game = $47

Money left = Total amount - Amount spent
Money left = $68 - $47
Money left = $21

Now, we can determine how many 7-dollar toys Roger can buy by dividing the money left by the cost of each toy.

Number of 7-dollar toys = Money left / Cost of each toy
Number of 7-dollar toys = $21 / $7
Number of 7-dollar toys = 3

Therefore, Roger can buy 3 seven-dollar toys with the money he has left.

For a birthday party Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 6 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up?
To determine the number of shelves Cody would fill up, we need to find the total number of sodas and divide it by the maximum number of sodas that can fit on each shelf.

The total number of sodas Cody bought is 4 regular sodas + 44 diet sodas = 48 sodas.

Since each shelf can hold 6 sodas, we divide the total number of sodas by 6 to find the number of shelves Cody would fill up: 48 sodas ÷ 6 sodas/shelf = 8 shelves.

Therefore, Cody would fill up 8 shelves with the sodas for the birthday party.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is8.

To find the total number of points scored, we need to determine the number of members who showed up and multiply it by the points each member scored.

Given that the trivia team had 15 members in total and 6 members didn't show up, we can calculate the number of members who did show up by subtracting the absent members from the total:

15 members - 6 absent members = 9 members who showed up.

Since each member who showed up scored 3 points, we can multiply the number of members by the points each member scored:

9 members * 3 points/member = 27 points.

Therefore, a total of 27 points were scored by the members who showed up.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is27.

Working video games = Total video games - Non-working video games
Working video games = 10 - 2
Working video games = 8

So, Dave has 8 working video games. If he sells each working game for $4, we can calculate his potential earnings by multiplying the number of working games by the price per game:

Earnings = Number of working games × Price per game
Earnings = 8 × $4
Earnings = $32

Therefore, Dave could earn $32 by selling his working video games.

In this scenario, we have 13 people in total, out of which 9 are kids. Since kids eat for free, we only need to consider the cost for the adults. 

The cost of each adult meal is $7, so we need to calculate the cost for the number of adults in the group. To do this, we subtract the number of kids (9) from the total number of people (13):

13 - 9 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 adults in the group. 

Now, we can calculate the cost for the adults by multiplying the number of adults (4) by the cost of each adult meal ($7):

4 * $7 = $28

They sold 7 puppies, so the number of puppies remaining is 13 - 7 = 6.

Now, we need to determine how many cages are needed to accommodate the remaining 6 puppies, with 2 puppies in each cage.

To find the number of cages, we divide the number of puppies by the number of puppies per cage:
Number of cages = Number of puppies / Puppies per cage

Number of cages = 6 puppies / 2 puppies per cage
Number of cages = 3 cages

Therefore, the pet store used 3 cages to house the remaining 6 puppies.

At the arcade, Tom won 32 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 25 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he spent 7 of his tickets on a hat, how many tickets does Tom have left?
To find out how many tickets Tom has left, we need to subtract the number of tickets he spent on the hat from the total number of tickets he won.

Tom won 32 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 25 tickets playing 'skee ball', so his total number of tickets won is 32 + 25 = 57 tickets.

If he spent 7 tickets on a hat, we subtract that from the total: 57 - 7 = 50.

Therefore, Tom has 50 tickets left after buying the hat.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is50.

John had 6 action figures, but needed 11 total for a complete collection. If each one costs $6, how much money would he need to finish his collection?
To find out how much money John would need to finish his collection, we first need to determine how many action figures he still needs. 

John currently has 6 action figures, and he needs a total of 11 for a complete collection. Therefore, he still needs 11 - 6 = 5 action figures.

Since each action figure costs $6, we can multiply the number of action figures John still needs (5) by the cost of each action figure ($6) to find the total amount of money he would need.

5 action figures * $6 per action figure = $<<5*6=30>>30

Therefore, John would need $30 to finish his collection.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$30.

Lana was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 4 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 2 scarves and 6 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Lana have total?
To find the total number of winter clothing pieces Lana had, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box.

Number of boxes: 4
Number of scarves in each box: 2
Number of mittens in each box: 6

To calculate the total number of scarves, we multiply the number of scarves in each box by the number of boxes:
2 scarves/box * 4 boxes = 8 scarves

To calculate the total number of mittens, we multiply the number of mittens in each box by the number of boxes:
6 mittens/box * 4 boxes = 24 mittens

Finally, to find the total number of winter clothing pieces, we add the number of scarves and mittens together:
8 scarves + 24 mittens = 32 pieces of winter clothing

Therefore, Lana had a total of 32 pieces of winter clothing.

To determine the number of loads Sarah would have to do, we need to divide the total number of clothing items by the capacity of her washing machine.

Let's start by calculating the total number of clothing items she needs to wash:
43 shirts + 2 sweaters = 45 clothing items

Now, we divide the total number of clothing items by the washing machine's capacity:
45 clothing items ÷ 5 pieces per load = 9 loads

Therefore, Sarah would have to do 9 loads in order to wash all 43 shirts and 2 sweaters.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is9.

To find out how many shirts Tom did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts he had to wash.

Total number of shirts = 10 short sleeve shirts + 25 long sleeve shirts = 35 shirts

Number of shirts Tom washed = 5 shirts

Number of shirts Tom did not wash = Total number of shirts - Number of shirts Tom washed
                                 = 35 shirts - 5 shirts
                                 = 30 shirts

To find out how many more cups of flour Tiffany needs, we can subtract the number of brownies she already baked from the total number of brownies she needs for her party.

Total number of brownies needed = 17
Number of brownies already baked = 8

Number of brownies still needed = Total number of brownies needed - Number of brownies already baked
Number of brownies still needed = 17 - 8
Number of brownies still needed = 9

Since Tiffany used 8 cups of flour for each brownie, we can calculate the total cups of flour she still needs by multiplying the number of brownies still needed by the cups of flour per brownie.

Total cups of flour still needed = Number of brownies still needed * Cups of flour per brownie
Total cups of flour still needed = 9 * 8
Total cups of flour still needed = 72

Therefore, Tiffany still needs 72 cups of flour to meet the total number of brownies required for her party.

To find the total number of cans, we add the cans from Saturday and Sunday: 25 cans + 15 cans = 40 cans.

Therefore, Frank picked up a total of 40 cans.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is40 cans.

A painter needed to paint 12 rooms in a building. Each room takes 3 hours to paint. If he already painted 4 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the remaining rooms, we need to calculate the total time it takes to paint all the rooms and subtract the time already spent.

The painter needs to paint 12 rooms, and each room takes 3 hours to paint. So, the total time required to paint all the rooms is 12 rooms * 3 hours/room = 36 hours.

Since the painter has already painted 4 rooms, we subtract the time spent on those rooms from the total time required: 4 rooms * 3 hours/room = 12 hours.

Therefore, the painter will take 36 hours - 12 hours = 24 hours longer to paint the remaining rooms.

Katie baked 18 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 8 of them how many packages could she make if she put 2 cupcake in each package?
To find out how many packages Katie could make, we need to determine the number of cupcakes she has left after her brother ate some. 

Katie initially baked 18 cupcakes, and her brother ate 8 of them. Therefore, the number of cupcakes remaining is 18 - 8 = 10 cupcakes.

Now, we can calculate the number of packages Katie can make by dividing the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package. Since she puts 2 cupcakes in each package, we divide 10 cupcakes by 2 cupcakes/package.

10 cupcakes ÷ 2 cupcakes/package = 5 packages

Therefore, Katie can make 5 packages with the remaining 10 cupcakes.

The cost of each rose is $3, and Robin bought 5 roses. So, the total cost of the roses is 5 * $3 = $15.

Similarly, the cost of each daisy is also $3, and Robin bought 4 daisies. Therefore, the total cost of the daisies is 4 * $3 = $12.

To find the total amount Robin spent, we add the cost of the roses and the daisies: $15 + $12 = $27.

Therefore, Robin spent $27 on 5 roses and 4 daisies from April's discount flowers.

Since each action figure costs $6, we can multiply the cost per action figure by the number of missing action figures to find the total amount of money Henry would need. 

5 missing action figures * $6 per action figure = $<<5*6=30>>30

Therefore, Henry would need $30 to finish his collection.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$30.

John earned 8 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 15 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 7 of them, how much money did he actually earn?
To find out how much money John actually earned, we need to calculate the number of lawns he mowed and multiply it by the amount he earned per lawn.

John had 15 lawns to mow, but he forgot to mow 7 of them. So, the number of lawns he actually mowed is 15 - 7 = 8 lawns.

Since John earned 8 dollars for each lawn he mowed, we can multiply the number of lawns he mowed by the amount he earned per lawn: 8 lawns * 8 dollars/lawn = 64 dollars.

Therefore, John actually earned 64 dollars.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is64.

There are 64 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 36 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 4 groups, how many students would be in each group?
To find out how many students would be in each group, we need to determine the number of students who were not picked for the team and divide it by the number of groups.

The number of students who didn't get picked for the team is 36, and the total number of students is 64. Therefore, the number of students who did get picked for the team is 64 - 36 = 28.

Now, we can divide the number of students who got picked for the team (28) by the number of groups (4) to find out how many students would be in each group.

28 ÷ 4 = 7

Hence, there would be 7 students in each group.

To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to subtract the number of apples the students actually wanted from the total number of apples ordered.

Total number of apples ordered = 8 red apples + 43 green apples = 51 apples
Number of students who wanted fruit = 42 students

To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the number of students who wanted fruit from the total number of apples ordered:
Extra apples = Total number of apples ordered - Number of students who wanted fruit
Extra apples = 51 apples - 42 students

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 9 extra apples.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is9.

To find the total number of books Megan had, we need to calculate the number of books on each type of shelf and then add them together.

Number of mystery book shelves: 8
Number of picture book shelves: 2

Since each shelf has exactly 7 books, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf for each type:

Number of mystery books = 8 shelves * 7 books per shelf = 56 books
Number of picture books = 2 shelves * 7 books per shelf = 14 books

Now, we can find the total number of books by adding the number of mystery books and the number of picture books:

Total number of books = Number of mystery books + Number of picture books
Total number of books = 56 books + 14 books = 70 books

Therefore, Megan has a total of 70 books in her bookcase.

Since there are 9 cages, and each cage has 2 parrots and 2 parakeets, we can calculate the total number of birds as follows:

Number of parrots = 9 cages * 2 parrots per cage = 18 parrots
Number of parakeets = 9 cages * 2 parakeets per cage = 18 parakeets

To find the total number of birds, we add the number of parrots and parakeets together:

Total number of birds = Number of parrots + Number of parakeets
Total number of birds = 18 parrots + 18 parakeets
Total number of birds = 36 birds

To calculate the amount of money the waiter earned, we need to determine the number of customers who left a tip and multiply it by the tip amount.

Given that there were 10 customers in total and 5 of them didn't leave a tip, we can find the number of customers who did tip by subtracting the non-tippers from the total number of customers:

Number of customers who tipped = Total customers - Non-tippers
Number of customers who tipped = 10 - 5
Number of customers who tipped = 5

Since each customer who tipped gave $3, we can multiply the number of customers who tipped by the tip amount to find the total earnings:

Total earnings = Number of customers who tipped * Tip amount
Total earnings = 5 * $3
Total earnings = $15

Therefore, the waiter earned $15 in total.

Every day, 4 puppies are adopted. We want to find out how long it will take for all the puppies to be adopted.

To determine the number of days needed, we divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.

36 puppies ÷ 4 puppies/day = 9 days

Therefore, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted if 4 puppies are adopted each day.

To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of oranges thrown away from the initial number of oranges in the bin, and then add the number of new oranges added.

Initial number of oranges in the bin = 31
Oranges thrown away = 9
New oranges added = 38

To find the final number of oranges in the bin, we can calculate:

Final number of oranges = (Initial number of oranges) - (Oranges thrown away) + (New oranges added)
Final number of oranges = 31 - 9 + 38

Now, let's perform the calculations:

Final number of oranges = 31 - 9 + 38
Final number of oranges = 22 + 38
Final number of oranges = 60

Therefore, there would be 60 oranges in the bin after throwing away 9 old ones and adding 38 new ones.

Tom bought 3 decks, and each deck costs 8 dollars. So, Tom spent 3 * 8 = 24 dollars.

His friend bought 5 decks, and each deck also costs 8 dollars. Therefore, his friend spent 5 * 8 = 40 dollars.

To find the total amount spent, we add Tom's and his friend's expenses: 24 + 40 = 64 dollars.

Therefore, Tom and his friend spent a total of 64 dollars on the trick decks from the magic shop.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is64.

Jerry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 8 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
To determine the number of trips Jerry will make, we need to calculate how many times he can carry 8 trays. 

From the first table, Jerry needs to pick up 9 trays, which is more than he can carry in one trip. Therefore, he will need to make 2 trips for the 9 trays (8 trays in the first trip and 1 tray in the second trip).

From the second table, Jerry needs to pick up 7 trays, which he can carry in one trip since it is less than 8 trays.

Therefore, Jerry will make a total of 2 trips for the first table and 1 trip for the second table, resulting in a total of 3 trips.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3 trips.

Tiffany uploaded a total of 7 pictures from her phone and 13 pictures from her camera, which gives us a total of 7 + 13 = 20 pictures.

Since she sorted the pictures into 5 different albums, we can divide the total number of pictures (20) by the number of albums (5):

20 ÷ 5 = 4

Therefore, there were 4 pictures in each of the albums.

Each chocolate bar in a box cost $4. If a box had 11 bars total and Vanessa sold all but 7 bars, how much money would she have made?
To find out how much money Vanessa would have made, we need to calculate the number of bars she sold and then multiply it by the cost per bar.

The total number of bars in the box is 11, and Vanessa sold all but 7 bars. So, the number of bars she sold is 11 - 7 = 4 bars.

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Vanessa made by multiplying the number of bars sold by the cost per bar. Each bar costs $4, so the total amount of money she made is 4 bars * $4/bar = $16.

Therefore, Vanessa would have made $16 by selling the chocolate bars.

The cafeteria had 47 apples. For lunch they handed out 27 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 4 apples, how many pies could they make?
To find out how many pies the cafeteria could make, we need to determine the number of apples remaining after handing out 27 to students. 

Initially, the cafeteria had 47 apples. After giving out 27 apples to students, we subtract 27 from 47:

47 - 27 = 20

So, the cafeteria has 20 apples left. 

Now, we need to determine how many pies can be made with these 20 apples. Since each pie requires 4 apples, we divide the total number of apples by 4:

20 ÷ 4 = 5

Therefore, the cafeteria can make 5 pies with the remaining 20 apples.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is5 pies.

To find out how many shelves were used, we need to determine the number of coloring books that remained after 20 were sold. 

Initially, the store had 40 coloring books in stock. After selling 20, we subtract that number from the initial stock: 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books remaining.

Since the store placed 4 coloring books on each shelf, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by 4 to find the number of shelves used: 20 / 4 = 5 shelves.

Therefore, the store used 5 shelves to display the remaining coloring books.

To find out how many cages were used, we need to determine the number of puppies that were not sold and then divide that number by the number of puppies in each cage.

The number of puppies not sold can be calculated by subtracting the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies:

64 puppies - 28 puppies = 36 puppies

Now, we divide the remaining 36 puppies by the number of puppies in each cage, which is 4:

36 puppies ÷ 4 puppies/cage = 9 cages

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages to house the remaining puppies.

To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Nancy finished from the total number of problems she had. 

Total number of problems Nancy had = 101
Number of problems Nancy finished = 47

Remaining number of problems = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
Remaining number of problems = 101 - 47
Remaining number of problems = 54

Since Nancy still had 6 pages of problems to do, we can divide the remaining number of problems by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page.

Number of problems on each page = Remaining number of problems / Number of pages
Number of problems on each page = 54 / 6
Number of problems on each page = 9

Carol initially made 30 cupcakes.
She sold 9 cupcakes.

Therefore, the number of cupcakes she had left after selling 9 is 30 - 9 = 21 cupcakes.

Next, we need to add the 28 cupcakes she made to the remaining 21 cupcakes.

21 + 28 = 49

To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we need to subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students who tried out.

The total number of students who tried out is the sum of the number of girls and boys:
Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of students = 17 girls + 32 boys
Total number of students = 49 students

Now, we subtract the number of students who got called back from the total number of students:
Number of students who didn't make the cut = Total number of students - Number of students called back
Number of students who didn't make the cut = 49 students - 10 students
Number of students who didn't make the cut = 39 students

Therefore, 39 students didn't make the cut for the basketball team.

To find the total number of winter clothing pieces Rachel has, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of scarves and mittens in each box.

Number of boxes: 7
Number of scarves in each box: 3
Number of mittens in each box: 4

To calculate the total number of scarves, we multiply the number of scarves in each box by the number of boxes:
Total number of scarves = 7 boxes * 3 scarves/box = 21 scarves

Similarly, to calculate the total number of mittens, we multiply the number of mittens in each box by the number of boxes:
Total number of mittens = 7 boxes * 4 mittens/box = 28 mittens

Finally, to find the total number of winter clothing pieces, we add the total number of scarves and mittens:
Total number of winter clothing pieces = Total number of scarves + Total number of mittens
Total number of winter clothing pieces = 21 scarves + 28 mittens = 49 pieces

Therefore, Rachel has a total of 49 pieces of winter clothing.

While shopping for music online, Isabel bought 4 country albums and 5 pop albums. Each album came with a lyric sheet and had 8 songs. How many songs did Isabel buy total?
To find the total number of songs Isabel bought, we need to multiply the number of albums by the number of songs per album.

Isabel bought 4 country albums, and each album has 8 songs. So, the total number of country songs is 4 albums * 8 songs/album = 32 songs.

Similarly, Isabel bought 5 pop albums, and each album has 8 songs. Therefore, the total number of pop songs is 5 albums * 8 songs/album = 40 songs.

To find the total number of songs Isabel bought, we add the number of country songs and pop songs: 32 songs + 40 songs = 72 songs.

Therefore, Isabel bought a total of 72 songs.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is72.

In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 5 points. If a level has 8 enemies total and you destroy all but 6 of them, how many points would you earn?
To calculate the number of points earned, we need to find the difference between the total number of enemies and the number of enemies destroyed. 

In this case, the total number of enemies is 8, and you destroy all but 6 of them. So, the number of enemies destroyed would be 8 - 6 = 2.

Since each defeated enemy gives you 5 points, you would earn 5 points for each enemy destroyed. Therefore, the total number of points earned would be 2 (number of enemies destroyed) multiplied by 5 (points per enemy), which equals 10 points.

So, you would earn 10 points by defeating all but 6 enemies in the level.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is10.

Mike made 42 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 10 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 8 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
To find out how many 8-dollar games Mike can buy, we need to subtract the amount he spent on mower blades from the total amount he made mowing lawns.

Total amount Mike made = $42
Amount spent on mower blades = $10

Money left after buying mower blades = Total amount made - Amount spent on mower blades
Money left = $42 - $10 = $32

Now, we can determine how many 8-dollar games Mike can buy with the money he has left.

Number of 8-dollar games = Money left / Cost of each game
Number of games = $32 / $8 = 4

Therefore, Mike can buy 4 eight-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the mower blades.

If Mike had 15 video games in total and 9 of them weren't working, we can subtract the non-working games from the total to find the number of working games: 

15 - 9 = 6

So, Mike has 6 working video games. 

If he sells each working game for $5, we can multiply the number of working games by the selling price to find the total amount of money he could earn: 

6 x $5 = $30

Therefore, Mike could earn $30 by selling his working video games.

Great problem! Let's solve it together.

Initially, there were 2 friends playing the game, and each had 3 lives. So, the total number of lives they had was 2 friends * 3 lives each = 6 lives.

Then, 2 more players joined the game. Since each player also had 3 lives, we need to add their lives to the total. 

2 players * 3 lives each = 6 lives.

Now, let's add up the lives of all the players:

6 lives (initial friends) + 6 lives (new players) = 12 lives.

Therefore, the total number of lives they had after the new players joined the game is 12 lives.

Final number of oranges = 10 + 24
Final number of oranges = 34

Given that there were 7 customers in total and 4 of them didn't leave a tip, we can determine that 7 - 4 = 3 customers did leave a tip.

Since each customer who tipped gave $9, we can multiply the number of tipping customers (3) by the amount received per tip ($9) to find the total earnings.

16 ÷ 4 = 4

Therefore, each person would get 4 chicken wings.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is4.

Kaleb had 10 video games but 8 of them weren't working. If he wanted to sell the working games for $6 each, how much money could he earn?
To find out how much money Kaleb could earn, we need to determine the number of working video games he has. 

Kaleb initially had 10 video games, and 8 of them weren't working. Therefore, the number of working video games can be calculated by subtracting the non-working ones from the total:

Working video games = Total video games - Non-working video games
Working video games = 10 - 8
Working video games = 2

So, Kaleb has 2 working video games. 

If he sells each working game for $6, the total amount of money he could earn can be calculated by multiplying the price per game by the number of working games:

Total money earned = Price per game × Number of working games
Total money earned = $6 × 2
Total money earned = $12

Therefore, Kaleb could earn $12 by selling his working video games.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$12.

Chloe was playing a trivia game. In the first round she scored 40 points and in the second round she scored 50 points. In the last round she lost 4 points. How many points did she have at the end of the game?
To find out how many points Chloe had at the end of the game, we need to add up her scores from each round and then subtract the points she lost in the last round.

Chloe scored 40 points in the first round and 50 points in the second round. So, the total points from the first two rounds are 40 + 50 = 90 points.

In the last round, Chloe lost 4 points. Therefore, we subtract 4 from the total points she had after the first two rounds: 90 - 4 = 86 points.

Hence, Chloe had 86 points at the end of the game.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is86.

A pet store has 6 bird cages. If each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets in it, how many birds does the pet store have total?
To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we need to multiply the number of cages by the number of birds in each cage.

Number of cages: 6
Number of parrots in each cage: 6
Number of parakeets in each cage: 2

Total number of birds in each cage: 6 (parrots) + 2 (parakeets) = 8 birds

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds in the pet store by multiplying the number of cages by the number of birds in each cage:

Total number of birds = Number of cages × Total number of birds in each cage
Total number of birds = 6 × 8
Total number of birds = 48

Therefore, the pet store has a total of 48 birds.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is48.

To determine the number of groups, we need to find out how many players there are in total and then divide that number by the number of players in each group.

The total number of players is the sum of the new players and the returning players:
2 new players + 6 returning players = 8 players

Now, we divide the total number of players by the number of players in each group:
8 players ÷ 4 players per group = 2 groups

Therefore, there would be 2 groups in total.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2.

At the arcade Cody won 49 tickets. If he spent 25 tickets on a beanie and later won 6 more tickets, how many would he have?
To solve this problem, we can start by subtracting the number of tickets Cody spent on the beanie from the total number of tickets he initially won. 

Total tickets won: 49
Tickets spent on beanie: 25

49 - 25 = 24

After spending 25 tickets on the beanie, Cody would have 24 tickets remaining. 

Next, we need to add the 6 additional tickets he won later.

24 + 6 = 30

Therefore, Cody would have 30 tickets in total after spending 25 tickets on a beanie and winning an additional 6 tickets.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is30.

A vase can hold 5 flowers. If you had 6 carnations and 19 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers?
To determine the number of vases needed to hold the flowers, we need to find out how many flowers can fit in one vase and then divide the total number of flowers by that amount.

Given that a vase can hold 5 flowers, we have a total of 6 carnations and 19 roses, which adds up to 6 + 19 = 25 flowers.

To find the number of vases needed, we divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers a vase can hold:
25 flowers ÷ 5 flowers/vase = 5 vases.

Therefore, you would need 5 vases to hold the 6 carnations and 19 roses.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is5 vases.

The school cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 21 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to calculate the total number of apples ordered and subtract the number of apples needed by the students.

Total number of red apples ordered = 33
Total number of green apples ordered = 23

Total number of apples ordered = 33 + 23 = 56

Number of students who wanted fruit = 21

To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the number of apples needed by the students from the total number of apples ordered:

Extra apples = Total apples ordered - Apples needed by students
Extra apples = 56 - 21 = 35

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 35 extra apples.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is35.

Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team?
To find the number of players on Emily's team, we can subtract Emily's score from the total score and then divide the remaining points by the number of points each player, excluding Emily, scored.

Let's denote the number of players on Emily's team as 'x'.

Total score - Emily's score = (2 points per player) * (number of players - 1)

39 - 23 = 2(x - 1)

16 = 2x - 2

Adding 2 to both sides:

16 + 2 = 2x

18 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

18/2 = x

x = 9

Therefore, there were 9 players on Emily's team.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is9.

To find out how many pies the cafeteria could make, we need to determine the number of apples remaining after handing out 30 to students. 

Initially, the cafeteria had 86 apples. After giving out 30 apples to students, we subtract 30 from 86:

86 - 30 = 56

So, there are 56 apples left for making pies. 

Since each pie requires 8 apples, we divide the number of remaining apples by 8 to find the number of pies:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Therefore, the cafeteria could make 7 pies with the remaining apples.
