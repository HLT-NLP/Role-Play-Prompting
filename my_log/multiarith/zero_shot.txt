Will made 104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 41 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 9 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?To find out how much money Will has left after buying the new mower blades, we need to subtract the cost of the blades from the total amount of money he made: $104 - $41 = $<<104-41=63>>63.
To find out how many $9 games Will can buy, we need to divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game: $63 / $9 = <<63/9=7>>7. Answer: \boxed{7}. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is7.

Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?Let n be the number of players on Bianca's team.
The total number of points scored by everyone else is 6 * (n - 1) = 6n - 6.
The total number of points scored by the team is 45 + 6n - 6 = 75.
Thus, 6n - 6 + 45 = 75.
Thus, 6n - 6 + 45 - 45 = 75 - 45.
Thus, 6n - 6 = 30.

In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 7 points. If a level has 11 enemies total and you destroy all but 8 of them, how many points would you earn?To find the number of points earned, we need to calculate the number of enemies defeated and then multiply it by the points earned per enemy.

The number of enemies defeated is given by the total number of enemies minus the number of enemies remaining: 11 - 8 = 3 enemies defeated.

Now, we multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points earned per enemy: 3 enemies defeated * 7 points per enemy = 21 points earned.

Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team?Let x be the number of players on Emily's team.
The total number of points scored by everyone else is 2(x-1).
The total number of points scored by everyone is 23 + 2(x-1) = 39.
Combining like terms, we get 2x - 2 + 23 = 39.
Combining like terms, we get 2x + 21 = 39.
Subtracting 21 from both sides, we get 2x = 18.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<9=9>>9. Answer: \boxed{9}. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is9.

A vase can hold 6 flowers. If you had 7 carnations and 47 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers?To determine the number of vases needed, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers a vase can hold.

The total number of flowers is 7 carnations + 47 roses = 54 flowers.
Since a vase can hold 6 flowers, we divide 54 flowers by 6 flowers/vase.
54 flowers / 6 flowers/vase = 9 vases.

Therefore, you would need 9 vases to hold the flowers. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is9.
