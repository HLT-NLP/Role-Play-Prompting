For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of candy Megan received.
Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors + 5 pieces from her older sister = <<11+5=16>>16 pieces of candy.

Step 2: Calculate the number of days the candy would last Megan if she ate 8 pieces a day.
16 pieces of candy / 8 pieces a day = <<16/8=2>>2 days.

Answer: The candy would last Megan 2 days if she ate 8 pieces a day.

Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the total number of carrots picked by Bianca and her mom. We can do this by adding the number of carrots each of them picked: 26 + 15 = <<26+15=41>>41 carrots.

Next, we need to find the number of bad carrots. We can do this by subtracting the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots: 41 - 16 = <<41-16=25>>25 bad carrots.

Therefore, Bianca and her mom had 25 bad carrots.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is25.

Paige and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 4 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds, how many points did they earn?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many points Paige earned for recycling 14 pounds of paper. We know that for every 4 pounds, they earn 1 point. So, we divide 14 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 pounds Paige recycled: 14 pounds / 4 pounds/set = <<14/4=3.5>>3.5 sets
Since Paige can't recycle a fraction of a set, we round down to the nearest whole number to find out how many points Paige earned: 3 sets * 1 point/set = <<3*1=3>>3 points

Next, we need to determine how many points Paige's friends earned for recycling 2 pounds of paper. We know that for every 4 pounds, they earn 1 point. So, we divide 2 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 pounds Paige's friends recycled: 2 pounds / 4 pounds/set = 0.5 sets
Since Paige's friends can't recycle a fraction of a set, they didn't earn any points.

Finally, we add up the points Paige earned and the points her friends earned to find the total number of points they earned: 3 points + 0 points = <<3+0=3>>3 points. Answer: \boxed{3}.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the number of trips needed to pick up the trays from the first table.
To pick up 23 trays from the first table, Victor will need to make 23/7 = <<23/7=3.2857142857142856>>3.29 trips.
Since Victor cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 4 trips to pick up all the trays from the first table.

Step 2: Calculate the number of trips needed to pick up the trays from the second table.
To pick up 5 trays from the second table, Victor will need to make 5/7 = <<5/7=0.7142857142857143>>0.71 trips.
Since Victor cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 1 trip to pick up all the trays from the second table.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of trips Victor will make.
To calculate the total number of trips, we add the number of trips needed for each table: 4 trips + 1 trip = 5 trips.

Nancy was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 52 seeds and planted 28 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Nancy have?
Let's think step by step.
First, let's find out how many seeds Nancy planted in total. She planted 28 seeds in the big garden and 4 seeds in each small garden. So the total number of seeds planted is 28 + 4x, where x is the number of small gardens.

We know that Nancy started with 52 seeds, so the equation becomes:
28 + 4x = 52

Now, let's solve for x. Subtracting 28 from both sides of the equation, we get:
4x = 52 - 28
4x = 24

Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we find:
x = 24/4
x = 6

Therefore, Nancy had 6 small gardens.

There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 5 players quit. If each player left had 5 lives, how many lives did they have total?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine the initial number of lives.
Since there were 8 friends playing the video game online, and each player had 5 lives, the initial number of lives is 8 * 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 lives.

Step 2: Determine the number of lives remaining after 5 players quit.
If 5 players quit the game, then the number of lives remaining is 40 - (5 * 5) = 40 - 25 = <<40-(5*5)=15>>15 lives.

Therefore, the total number of lives they had after 5 players quit is 15 lives.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is15.

Isabel had 72 homework problems. She finished 32 of them but still had 5 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Isabel had 72 homework problems.
Step 2: She finished 32 of them.
Step 3: She still had 5 pages of problems to do.
Step 4: We need to find out how many problems are on each page.

To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to subtract the number of problems Isabel finished from the total number of problems she had. This will give us the number of problems she still needs to do.

Total number of problems - Number of problems finished = Number of problems still to do
72 - 32 = 40

So Isabel still has 40 problems to do.

Since she has 5 pages of problems to do, we can divide the number of problems she still needs to do by the number of pages to find out how many problems are on each page.

Number of problems still to do / Number of pages = Number of problems on each page
40 / 5 = 8

So there are 8 problems on each page.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is8.

Olivia picked 20 carrots and her mom picked 14 carrots, so the total number of carrots picked is 20 + 14 = <<20+14=34>>34.

Step 2: Subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked.
If only 19 of the carrots were good, then the number of bad carrots is 34 - 19 = <<34-19=15>>15.

Answer: Olivia and her mom had 15 bad carrots.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is15.

Faye had 46 math problems and 9 science problems for homework. If she finished 40 of the problems at school, how many problems did she have to do for homework?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Find the total number of problems Faye had for homework.
To find the total number of problems Faye had for homework, we need to add the number of math problems and the number of science problems. 

Math problems: 46
Science problems: 9

Total number of problems for homework = 46 + 9 = 55

Step 2: Subtract the number of problems Faye finished at school from the total number of problems for homework.
Faye finished 40 problems at school, so we need to subtract 40 from the total number of problems for homework.

Total number of problems for homework - Problems finished at school = 55 - 40 = 15

Therefore, Faye had to do 15 problems for homework.

Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed 5 total for her party. If she used 5 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of brownies Isabel still needs for her party.
Isabel baked 3 brownies, but she needs 5 total, so she still needs 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 brownies.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of flour Isabel used on the brownies she baked.
Isabel used 5 cups of flour on each brownie, so she used a total of 5 * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 cups of flour.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour Isabel still needs.
Since Isabel still needs to bake 2 brownies, she still needs 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 cups of flour. Answer: \boxed{10}.

Gwen and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds, how many points did they earn?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many points Gwen earned for recycling 5 pounds of paper. We know that for every 3 pounds, they earn one point. So, we divide 5 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds Gwen recycled: 5 pounds / 3 pounds/set = 1.67 sets.
Since Gwen can't recycle a fraction of a set, we round down to the nearest whole number to find out how many points Gwen earned: 1 set.
Next, we need to find out how many points Gwen's friends earned for recycling 13 pounds of paper. Again, we divide 13 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds Gwen's friends recycled: 13 pounds / 3 pounds/set = 4.33 sets.
Since Gwen's friends can't recycle a fraction of a set, we round down to the nearest whole number to find out how many points Gwen's friends earned: 4 sets.
Finally, we add up the number of points Gwen earned (1 point) and the number of points her friends earned (4 points) to find the total number of points they earned: 1 point + 4 points = 5 points. Answer: \boxed{5}.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is5.

There were 11 friends playing a video game online when 5 players quit. If each player left had 5 lives, how many lives did they have total?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of lives before any players quit.
Since there were 11 friends playing the game, and each player had 5 lives, the total number of lives before any players quit is 11 * 5 = <<11*5=55>>55 lives.

Step 2: Calculate the number of lives remaining after 5 players quit.
If 5 players quit the game, then the number of lives remaining is 55 - (5 * 5) = 55 - 25 = <<55-(5*5)=30>>30 lives.

Therefore, the total number of lives they had after 5 players quit is 30 lives.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the daisies.
Katie bought 5 daisies, and each daisy costs $6. So the total cost of the daisies is 5 * $6 = $<<5*6=30>>30.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
The cost of the roses is $30 and the cost of the daisies is $30. So the total cost is $30 + $30 = $<<30+30=60>>60.

Therefore, Katie spent $60 on flowers.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is60.

Since there were 15 people in total and 8 were kids, the number of adults would be 15 - 8 = <<15-8=7>>7.

A painter needed to paint 10 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 8 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of rooms the painter needs to paint.
The painter needs to paint 10 rooms in total.

Step 2: Calculate the number of rooms the painter has already painted.
The painter has already painted 8 rooms.

Step 3: Calculate the number of rooms the painter still needs to paint.
To find the number of rooms the painter still needs to paint, subtract the number of rooms already painted from the total number of rooms: 10 - 8 = 2 rooms.

Step 4: Calculate the total time needed to paint the remaining rooms.
Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, the painter will need 8 hours x 2 rooms = 16 hours to paint the remaining rooms.

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 16 hours to paint the rest of the rooms.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is16

Henry earned 5 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 12 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 7 of them, how much money did he actually earn?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many lawns Henry actually mowed. To do this, we subtract the number of lawns he forgot to mow from the total number of lawns he had to mow: 12 lawns - 7 lawns = <<12-7=5>>5 lawns.

Next, we multiply the number of lawns Henry mowed by the amount he earned for each lawn: 5 lawns * $5/lawn = $<<5*5=25>>25.

Therefore, Henry actually earned $25.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is25.

There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 3 players quit. If each player left had 3 lives, how many lives did they have total?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine the initial number of lives.
Since there were 8 friends playing the video game online, and each player had 3 lives, the initial number of lives is 8 * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 lives.

Step 2: Determine the number of lives lost.
If 3 players quit the game, then the number of lives lost is 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 lives.

Step 3: Determine the total number of lives remaining.
To find the total number of lives remaining, subtract the number of lives lost from the initial number of lives: 24 - 9 = <<24-9=15>>15 lives.

Therefore, the friends had a total of 15 lives remaining.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is15.

Each chocolate bar in a box cost $3. If a box had 9 bars total and Wendy sold all but 3 bars, how much money would she have made?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the chocolate bars in the box.
Since each chocolate bar costs $3 and there are 9 bars in total, the total cost of the chocolate bars in the box is 9 * $3 = $<<9*3=27>>27.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the 3 bars that Wendy did not sell.
Since each chocolate bar costs $3, the cost of the 3 bars that Wendy did not sell is 3 * $3 = $<<3*3=9>>9.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Wendy made by selling the chocolate bars.
Since the total cost of the chocolate bars in the box is $27 and Wendy did not sell 3 bars worth $9, she made $27 - $9 = $<<27-9=18>>18.

Therefore, Wendy made $18 by selling the chocolate bars.

Maria was making baggies of cookies with 3 cookies in each bag. If she had 2 chocolate chip cookies and 16 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine the total number of cookies Maria has. To do this, we add the number of chocolate chip cookies (2) to the number of oatmeal cookies (16): 2 + 16 = <<2+16=18>>18 cookies.

Next, we need to determine how many baggies Maria can make. Since each baggie contains 3 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 3: 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 baggies.

Therefore, Maria can make 6 baggies of cookies.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free. If a group of 11 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine the number of adults in the group.
Since there are 11 people in total and 2 of them are kids, the remaining 11 - 2 = <<11-2=9>>9 people must be adults.

Step 2: Calculate the cost for the adults.
Since each adult meal costs $8, the total cost for the adults would be 9 * $8 = $<<9*8=72>>72.

Step 3: Calculate the cost for the kids.
Since kids eat for free, the cost for the kids would be $0.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for the group.
The total cost for the group would be $72 + $0 = $<<72+0=72>>72.

Therefore, it would cost $72 for the group to eat.

Roger was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 10 trays from one table and 2 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
Let's think step by step.
First, let's calculate how many trips Roger will need to make to pick up the 10 trays from one table. Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, he will need to make 10 / 4 = <<10/4=2.5>>2.5 trips.
Since Roger cannot make half a trip, he will need to make 3 trips to pick up the 10 trays from one table.
Next, let's calculate how many trips Roger will need to make to pick up the 2 trays from the other table. Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, he will need to make 2 / 4 = 0.5 trips.
Again, since Roger cannot make half a trip, he will need to make 1 trip to pick up the 2 trays from the other table.
Therefore, in total, Roger will need to make 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 trips. Answer: \boxed{4}.

Each chocolate bar in a box cost $6. If a box had 13 bars total and Zoe sold all but 6 bars, how much money would she have made?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many bars Zoe sold. To do this, we subtract the number of bars she kept from the total number of bars: 13 bars - 6 bars = <<13-6=7>>7 bars.

Next, we need to find out how much money Zoe made from selling these bars. Since each bar costs $6, we multiply the number of bars sold by the price per bar: 7 bars * $6/bar = $<<7*6=42>>42.

Therefore, Zoe would have made $42 from selling the chocolate bars.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is42.

A waiter had 44 customers in his section. If 12 of them left and the rest of his tables had 8 people at each table, how many tables did he have?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: We know that the waiter had 44 customers in his section.
Step 2: 12 of them left, so we subtract 12 from 44 to find out how many customers are left: 44 - 12 = 32 customers.
Step 3: We know that the rest of the tables had 8 people at each table. To find out how many tables the waiter had, we divide the number of customers by the number of people at each table: 32 / 8 = 4 tables.

Haley and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many points Haley earned. To do this, we divide the number of pounds she recycled by the number of pounds needed to earn one point: 11 pounds / 3 pounds/point = <<11/3=3.6666666666666665>>3.67 points
Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we round down to the nearest whole number: 3.67 points rounded down = <<3.67=3>>3 points
Next, we need to find out how many points Haley's friends earned. To do this, we divide the number of pounds they recycled by the number of pounds needed to earn one point: 16 pounds / 3 pounds/point = <<16/3=5.333333333333333>>5.33 points
Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we round down to the nearest whole number: 5.33 points rounded down = <<5.33=5>>5 points
Finally, we add up the number of points Haley earned and the number of points her friends earned to find the total number of points: 3 points + 5 points = <<3+5=8>>8 points. Answer: \boxed{8}.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is8.

Since Gwen earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled, she would have earned 8 points x 4 bags = <<8*4=32>>32 points if she recycled all 4 bags.

Step 2: Calculate the number of points Gwen would have earned if she recycled only 2 bags.
Since Gwen didn't recycle 2 of the bags, she would have earned 8 points x 2 bags = <<8*2=16>>16 points if she recycled only 2 bags.

Step 3: Calculate the number of points Gwen would have earned if she recycled 4 bags but didn't recycle 2 of them.
To find the number of points Gwen would have earned if she recycled 4 bags but didn't recycle 2 of them, we need to subtract the number of points she would have earned if she recycled only 2 bags from the number of points she would have earned if she recycled all 4 bags.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the number of trips needed to pick up the trays from the first table.
To calculate the number of trips needed to pick up the trays from the first table, divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Dave can carry in one trip: 17 trays / 9 trays/trip = 1.8888... trips.
Since Dave cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to pick up all the trays from the first table.

Step 2: Calculate the number of trips needed to pick up the trays from the second table.
To calculate the number of trips needed to pick up the trays from the second table, divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Dave can carry in one trip: 55 trays / 9 trays/trip = 6.1111... trips.
Since Dave cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 7 trips to pick up all the trays from the second table.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of trips Dave will make.
To calculate the total number of trips Dave will make, add the number of trips needed for each table: 2 trips + 7 trips = 9 trips.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many points Haley earned. To do this, we divide the number of pounds she recycled by the number of pounds needed to earn one point: 11 pounds / 3 pounds/point = <<11/3=3.6666666666666665>>3.67 points
Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we round down to the nearest whole number: 3.67 points rounded down = <<3.67=3>>3 points
Next, we need to find out how many points Haley's friends earned. To do this, we divide the number of pounds they recycled by the number of pounds needed to earn one point: 16 pounds / 3 pounds/point = <<16/3=5.333333333333333>>5.33 points
Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we round down to the nearest whole number: 5.33 points rounded down = <<5.33=5>>5 points

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many points Vanessa earned for recycling 20 pounds of paper. We know that for every 9 pounds, they earn 1 point. So, we can divide 20 by 9 to find out how many sets of 9 pounds are in 20 pounds.

20 pounds / 9 pounds = 2 sets

So, Vanessa earned 2 points for recycling 20 pounds of paper.

Next, we need to find out how many points Vanessa's friends earned for recycling 16 pounds of paper. Again, we know that for every 9 pounds, they earn 1 point. So, we can divide 16 by 9 to find out how many sets of 9 pounds are in 16 pounds.

16 pounds / 9 pounds = 1 set

So, Vanessa's friends earned 1 point for recycling 16 pounds of paper.

Finally, we can add up the points Vanessa earned and the points her friends earned to find out the total number of points they earned.

2 points + 1 point = 3 points

Therefore, Vanessa and her friends earned a total of 3 points for recycling paper.

Katie's team won their dodgeball game and scored 12 points total. If Katie scored 4 of the points and everyone else scored 4 points each, how many players were on her team?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume there were x players on Katie's team.
Step 2: Katie scored 4 points, so the remaining players scored a total of 12 - 4 = 8 points.
Step 3: Each of the remaining players scored 4 points, so there were (x - 1) players who scored 4 points each.
Step 4: The total number of points scored by the remaining players is (x - 1) * 4 = 8.
Step 5: Solving the equation (x - 1) * 4 = 8, we find that x - 1 = 8 / 4 = 2.
Step 6: Adding 1 to both sides of the equation, we find that x = 2 + 1 = 3.
Step 7: Therefore, there were 3 players on Katie's team.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.

Henry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another, how many trips will he make?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the number of trips needed to pick up the trays from the first table.
To calculate the number of trips needed to pick up the trays from the first table, divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Henry can carry in one trip: 29 trays / 9 trays/trip = 3.22 trips.
Since Henry cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 4 trips to pick up all the trays from the first table.

Step 2: Calculate the number of trips needed to pick up the trays from the second table.
To calculate the number of trips needed to pick up the trays from the second table, divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Henry can carry in one trip: 52 trays / 9 trays/trip = 5.78 trips.
Since Henry cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 6 trips to pick up all the trays from the second table.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of trips Henry will make.
To calculate the total number of trips Henry will make, add the number of trips needed to pick up the trays from the first table to the number of trips needed to pick up the trays from the second table: 4 trips + 6 trips = 10 trips.

Answer: Henry will make 10 trips in total.

At a restaurant each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 9 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many adults are in the group. To do this, we subtract the number of kids from the total number of people: 15 people - 9 kids = <<15-9=6>>6 adults.

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the adults. Since each adult meal costs $2, we multiply the number of adults by the cost per adult meal: 6 adults * $2/adult = $<<6*2=12>>12.

Since kids eat for free, the cost for the kids is $0.

Finally, we add the cost for the adults and the cost for the kids to find the total cost: $12 + $0 = $<<12+0=12>>12.

Therefore, it would cost $12 for the group to eat.

At the arcade, Tom won 32 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 25 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he spent 7 of his tickets on a hat, how many tickets does Tom have left?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total number of tickets Tom won.
To find the total number of tickets Tom won, add the number of tickets he won playing 'whack a mole' (32 tickets) and the number of tickets he won playing 'skee ball' (25 tickets): 32 tickets + 25 tickets = <<32+25=57>>57 tickets.

Step 2: Subtract the number of tickets Tom spent on the hat from the total number of tickets he won.
To find the number of tickets Tom has left, subtract the number of tickets he spent on the hat (7 tickets) from the total number of tickets he won (57 tickets): 57 tickets - 7 tickets = <<57-7=50>>50 tickets.

Answer: Tom has 50 tickets left.

Bianca and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Bianca recycled 24 pounds and her friends recycled 3 pounds, how many points did they earn?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how many points Bianca earned for recycling 24 pounds of paper. We know that for every 3 pounds, they earn 1 point. So, we divide 24 by 3 to find out how many groups of 3 pounds there are: 24 pounds / 3 pounds/group = <<24/3=8>>8 groups.
Since each group of 3 pounds earns 1 point, we can conclude that Bianca earned 8 points for recycling 24 pounds of paper.

Next, we need to determine how many points Bianca's friends earned for recycling 3 pounds of paper. We know that for every 3 pounds, they earn 1 point. Since they recycled 3 pounds, they earn 1 point.

Finally, we need to determine the total number of points earned by Bianca and her friends. We add the number of points Bianca earned (8 points) to the number of points her friends earned (1 point) to find the total: 8 points + 1 point = <<8+1=9>>9 points.

Therefore, Bianca and her friends earned a total of 9 points for recycling paper.

Sarah had 4 pages of math homework and 6 pages of reading homework. If each page had 4 problems on it, how many problems did she have to complete total?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the total number of math problems. Since Sarah had 4 pages of math homework and each page had 4 problems, she had 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 math problems.

Next, we need to find the total number of reading problems. Since Sarah had 6 pages of reading homework and each page had 4 problems, she had 6 * 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 reading problems.

Finally, we need to find the total number of problems Sarah had to complete. Since she had 16 math problems and 24 reading problems, she had to complete 16 + 24 = <<16+24=40>>40 problems in total. Answer: \boxed{40}.

Henry had 3 action figures, but needed 8 total for a complete collection. If each one costs $6, how much money would he need to finish his collection?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Determine how many more action figures Henry needs to complete his collection.
To find out how many more action figures Henry needs, we subtract the number of action figures he already has from the total number of action figures in a complete collection: 8 total action figures - 3 action figures Henry already has = <<8-3=5>>5 more action figures needed.

Step 2: Determine the cost of the remaining action figures.
To find out how much money Henry needs to finish his collection, we multiply the number of remaining action figures by the cost of each action figure: 5 remaining action figures * $6 per action figure = $<<5*6=30>>30.

Step 3: Determine the final answer.
Henry would need $30 to finish his collection.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$30.

Isabel picked 66 flowers for her friendâ€™s wedding. She was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one. If 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the number of flowers that are still usable.
To find the number of flowers that are still usable, subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers: 66 flowers - 10 wilted flowers = <<66-10=56>>56 usable flowers.

Step 2: Calculate the number of bouquets Isabel can make.
To find the number of bouquets Isabel can make, divide the number of usable flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet: 56 usable flowers / 8 flowers per bouquet = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets. Answer: \boxed{7}.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is7.

In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 5 points. If a level has 8 enemies total and you destroy all but 6 of them, how many points would you earn?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the number of enemies defeated.
To find the number of enemies defeated, subtract the number of enemies remaining from the total number of enemies: 8 - 6 = 2 enemies defeated.

Step 2: Calculate the number of points earned.
Since each enemy defeated gives you 5 points, multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points earned per enemy: 2 enemies defeated * 5 points/enemy = 10 points earned.

Therefore, you would earn 10 points.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is10.

Sarah was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 21 seeds and planted 12 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each. How many small gardens did Sarah have?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many seeds Sarah planted in total. She planted 12 seeds in the big garden and 3 seeds in each small garden. So, she planted 12 + (3 x number of small gardens) seeds in total.

Next, we need to find out how many small gardens Sarah had. To do this, we can subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds planted. So, the equation becomes: 21 - 12 = 3 x number of small gardens.

Now, we can solve for the number of small gardens. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get: number of small gardens = (21 - 12) / 3.

Calculating this, we find that Sarah had (21 - 12) / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3 small gardens.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is3.
