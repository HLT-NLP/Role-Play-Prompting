Which choice is true ? Answer Choices: (A) fullback. (B) cheerleader. (C) left winger.
Let's think step by step.
1. At the start of the match, Alice is playing fullback, Bob is playing cheerleader, and Claire is playing left winger.

2. Alice and Claire trade positions. This means Alice is now playing left winger and Claire is playing fullback. Bob's position remains unchanged.

3. Bob and Alice trade positions. Since Alice is now playing left winger, Bob becomes the left winger and Alice becomes the cheerleader. Claire's position remains unchanged.

4. Bob and Claire trade positions. Since Bob is now the left winger, Claire becomes the cheerleader and Bob becomes the fullback. Alice's position remains unchanged.

At the end of the match, Claire is playing the position that Bob started with, which is the left winger. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) left winger.
