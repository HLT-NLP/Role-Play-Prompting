The value of a sport utility vehicle this year is 16,000 dollars , which is 0.8 of what its value was last year. How much is the value of the vehicle last year?
To find the value of the vehicle last year, we can set up an equation using the given information. Let's represent the value of the vehicle last year as "x".

According to the problem, the value of the vehicle this year is 0.8 times the value of the vehicle last year. Mathematically, we can express this as:

0.8 * x = 16,000

To solve for "x", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.8:

x = 16,000 / 0.8

Evaluating the right side of the equation, we find:

x = 20,000

Therefore, the value of the vehicle last year was $20,000.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isThe value of the vehicle last year was $20,000.

Jonathan wants to buy a dictionary that costs $11, a dinosaur book that costs $19, and a children's cookbook that costs $7. He has saved $8 from his allowance. How much more money does Jonathan need to buy all three books?
To find out how much more money Jonathan needs to buy all three books, we need to calculate the total cost of the books and subtract the amount he has already saved.

The cost of the dictionary is $11, the dinosaur book is $19, and the children's cookbook is $7. To find the total cost, we add these amounts together:

$11 + $19 + $7 = $37

So, the total cost of the three books is $37.

Michelle began her pizza delivery route with 0.5 of a tank of gas in her car. When she made it back to the pizzeria, 0.16666666666666666 of a tank of gas was left. How much gas did Michelle use?
To find out how much gas Michelle used, we can subtract the amount of gas left from the initial amount she had. 

Initial amount of gas = 0.5 tank
Amount of gas left = 0.16666666666666666 tank

Gas used = Initial amount of gas - Amount of gas left
Gas used = 0.5 tank - 0.16666666666666666 tank

To subtract these fractions, we need to have a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 6.

Gas used = (0.5 * 6) tank - (0.16666666666666666 * 6) tank
Gas used = 3/6 tank - 1/6 tank
Gas used = (3 - 1)/6 tank
Gas used = 2/6 tank

Simplifying the fraction, we get:
Gas used = 1/3 tank

Therefore, Michelle used 1/3 tank of gas for her pizza delivery route.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1/3 tank.

To find out how much longer the white line is than the blue line, we need to subtract the length of the blue line from the length of the white line.

White line length: 7.666666666666667 inches
Blue line length: 3.3333333333333335 inches

To subtract these two lengths, we can simply subtract the blue line length from the white line length:

Oceanside Bike Rental Shop charges 17 dollars plus 7 dollars an hour for renting a bike. Tom paid 80 dollars to rent a bike. How many hours did he pay to have the bike checked out ?
To solve this problem, let's assume that Tom rented the bike for "x" hours.

According to the given information, the rental shop charges $17 plus $7 per hour. So, the total cost of renting the bike for "x" hours can be expressed as:

Total cost = $17 + $7x

We know that Tom paid $80 to rent the bike. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$80 = $17 + $7x

To find the value of "x," we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's subtract $17 from both sides:

$80 - $17 = $7x

Simplifying the left side:

$63 = $7x

Now, divide both sides by $7:

$63 / $7 = x

x = 9

Therefore, Tom paid to have the bike checked out for 9 hours.

Mrs. Hilt went to a concert. A total of 65899 people attended the concert. The next week, Mrs. Hilt went to a second concert, which had 119 more people in attendance. How many people were at the second concert?
To find out how many people were at the second concert, we need to add 119 to the total number of people who attended the first concert.

Total number of people at the first concert = 65899
Number of people at the second concert = Total number of people at the first concert + 119

Number of people at the second concert = 65899 + 119
Number of people at the second concert = 66018

Therefore, there were 66,018 people at the second concert.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is66018.

To find out how many pitchers of lemonade Jonah poured in total, we need to add up the amounts he served during each intermission.

During the first intermission, Jonah served 0.25 of a pitcher.
During the second intermission, he served 0.4166666666666667 of a pitcher.
During the third intermission, he served 0.25 of a pitcher.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 1. So, we can rewrite the fractions as follows:

0.25 = 0.25/1
0.4166666666666667 = 0.4166666666666667/1
0.25 = 0.25/1

Now, let's add them up:

0.25/1 + 0.4166666666666667/1 + 0.25/1 = (0.25 + 0.4166666666666667 + 0.25)/1

Adding the numerators gives us:

(0.25 + 0.4166666666666667 + 0.25)/1 = 0.9166666666666667/1

So, Jonah poured a total of 0.9166666666666667 pitchers of lemonade during the school play.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.9166666666666667 pitchers of lemonade.

Alyssa spent half of her allowance going to the movies. She washed the family car and earned 8 dollars. What is her weekly allowance if she ended with 12 dollars ?
To find out Alyssa's weekly allowance, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's assume her weekly allowance is represented by the variable 'x'.

According to the problem, Alyssa spent half of her allowance going to the movies, which means she spent (1/2)x dollars.

She also earned 8 dollars by washing the family car.

If she ended up with 12 dollars, we can set up the equation:

x - (1/2)x + 8 = 12

To solve this equation, we can simplify it:

(1/2)x + 8 = 12

Subtract 8 from both sides:

(1/2)x = 4

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 8

Therefore, Alyssa's weekly allowance is 8 dollars.

On Friday, Sam spent 2 pennies on ice cream. The next day, Sam spent 12 dimes on baseball cards. All in all, how much money did Sam spend?
To find out how much money Sam spent, we need to convert the amounts to a common unit of currency. Let's convert the pennies to dimes since they are both in the same currency.

Since there are 10 dimes in a dollar, we can say that 1 dime is equal to 10 pennies.

Sam spent 2 pennies, which is equivalent to 2/10 = 0.2 dimes.

On the next day, Sam spent 12 dimes on baseball cards.

Adding the amount spent on ice cream (0.2 dimes) to the amount spent on baseball cards (12 dimes), we get:

0.2 dimes + 12 dimes = 12.2 dimes.

Therefore, Sam spent a total of 12.2 dimes.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is12.2 dimes.

Trenton sells electronic supplies. Each week he earns 190 dollars plus commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. This week his goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. How much sales  he must make to reach his goal?
To find out how much sales Trenton must make to reach his goal, we can set up an equation.

Let's assume his sales for the week are 'x' dollars.

According to the given information, Trenton earns a base salary of 190 dollars plus a commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. So, his total earnings for the week can be expressed as:

Total earnings = Base salary + Commission
Total earnings = 190 + 0.04x

We know that Trenton's goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:

Total earnings ≥ 500

Substituting the expression for total earnings, we have:

190 + 0.04x ≥ 500

Now, let's solve this inequality to find the minimum sales Trenton must make:

190 + 0.04x ≥ 500
0.04x ≥ 500 - 190
0.04x ≥ 310

To isolate 'x', we divide both sides of the inequality by 0.04:

x ≥ 310 / 0.04
x ≥ 7750

Therefore, Trenton must make sales of at least 7750 dollars to reach his goal of earning no less than 500 dollars.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is7750.

Freeport McMoran projects the world grain supply will be 1800000 metric tons and the supply will be only 0.75 of the world grain demand. What will the world grain demand be?
To find the world grain demand, we can use the information provided by Freeport McMoran. They state that the world grain supply will be 1,800,000 metric tons, and this supply will only be 0.75 (or 75%) of the world grain demand.

Let's denote the world grain demand as "D". According to the given information, we can set up the following equation:

1,800,000 = 0.75 * D

To solve for D, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

D = 1,800,000 / 0.75

Using a calculator, we can evaluate this expression:

D ≈ 2,400,000 metric tons

Therefore, based on the information provided, the world grain demand is estimated to be approximately 2,400,000 metric tons.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2,400,000 metric tons.

For his long distance phone service Milan pays a 2 dollars monthly fee plus 12 cents per minute. Last month , Milan 's long distance bill was 23.36 dollars. For how many minutes was Milan billed for ?
To find out the number of minutes Milan was billed for, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's assume the number of minutes Milan was billed for is represented by 'm'.

According to the problem, Milan pays a $2 monthly fee plus 12 cents per minute. So, the total cost of the long-distance bill can be expressed as:

Total cost = Monthly fee + Cost per minute * Number of minutes
23.36 = 2 + 0.12m

To isolate 'm', we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
23.36 - 2 = 0.12m
21.36 = 0.12m

Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.12 to solve for 'm':
m = 21.36 / 0.12
m ≈ 178

Therefore, Milan was billed for approximately 178 minutes.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is178.

At Lindsey's Vacation Wear, 0.375 of the garments are bikinis and 0.25 are trunks. What fraction of the garments are either bikinis or trunks?
To find the fraction of garments that are either bikinis or trunks, we need to add the fractions representing each category. 

The fraction of garments that are bikinis is 0.375, and the fraction of garments that are trunks is 0.25. 

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the smallest common denominator is 1000, as both fractions can be expressed with three decimal places. 

Converting 0.375 to a fraction with a denominator of 1000, we get 375/1000. 

Converting 0.25 to a fraction with a denominator of 1000, we get 250/1000. 

Now, we can add these fractions: 

375/1000 + 250/1000 = 625/1000. 

Therefore, the fraction of garments that are either bikinis or trunks is 625/1000.

To find out how much more pie Erik ate than Frank, we need to subtract the amount Frank ate from the amount Erik ate.

Erik ate 0.6666666666666666 of a pie.
Frank ate 0.3333333333333333 of a pie.

To subtract these fractions, we need to have a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 1.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 1:
Erik ate (0.6666666666666666 * 1) = 0.6666666666666666 of a pie.
Frank ate (0.3333333333333333 * 1) = 0.3333333333333333 of a pie.

Now, we can subtract the fractions:
0.6666666666666666 - 0.3333333333333333 = 0.3333333333333333

Therefore, Erik ate 0.3333333333333333 more pie than Frank.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.3333333333333333

Mrs. Hilt is baking bread. She needs 5 cups of flour to bake 2 loaves of bread. How much flour will she need to make one loaf of bread?
To find out how much flour Mrs. Hilt will need to make one loaf of bread, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

Let's assume x represents the amount of flour needed for one loaf of bread.

We know that 5 cups of flour are needed for 2 loaves of bread. So, we can set up the following proportion:

5 cups / 2 loaves = x cups / 1 loaf

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * x = 5 * 1

2x = 5

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x:

x = 5 / 2

Therefore, Mrs. Hilt will need 2.5 cups of flour to make one loaf of bread.

x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 69

Now, let's solve the equation:

3x + 6 = 69
3x = 69 - 6
3x = 63
x = 63 / 3
x = 21

When Jake had one cat, he needed to serve 0.5 of a can of cat food each day. Now that Jake has adopted a second cat, he needs to serve a total of 0.9 of a can each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the second cat?
To find out how much extra food is needed to feed the second cat, we can subtract the amount of food needed for one cat from the total amount needed for both cats.

Let's denote the amount of food needed for one cat as x. According to the problem, when Jake had one cat, he needed to serve 0.5 of a can each day. Therefore, we have the equation:

x = 0.5

Now, with two cats, Jake needs to serve a total of 0.9 of a can each day. We can express this as:

2x = 0.9

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 0.9 / 2
x = 0.45

So, the amount of food needed for one cat is 0.45 cans per day. To find the extra food needed for the second cat, we subtract the amount needed for one cat from the total amount needed for both cats:

Extra food = Total amount needed - Amount needed for one cat
Extra food = 0.9 - 0.45
Extra food = 0.45 cans per day

Therefore, Jake needs an extra 0.45 cans of cat food each day to feed the second cat.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.45 cans per day.

Benny bought 4 new baseball trading cards to add to his collection. The next day his dog ate half of his collection. There are now only 34 cards left. How many cards did Benny start with ?
To find out how many cards Benny started with, we can work backwards from the information given. 

Let's assume that Benny started with "x" number of cards in his collection. 

According to the problem, Benny bought 4 new baseball trading cards, so we can add 4 to his initial collection: x + 4.

The next day, his dog ate half of his collection, which means he was left with half of the cards. So, we can express this as (1/2)(x + 4).

According to the problem, there are now only 34 cards left, so we can set up the equation:

(1/2)(x + 4) = 34

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

x + 4 = 68

Next, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 68 - 4

x = 64

Therefore, Benny started with 64 cards in his collection.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is64.

To find the fraction of the Montoya family's budget spent on food, we need to add the fractions representing the amount spent on groceries and going out to eat.

The fraction spent on groceries is 0.6, and the fraction spent on going out to eat is 0.2. To add these fractions, we need to have a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 10.

Converting 0.6 to a fraction with a denominator of 10, we get 6/10. Similarly, converting 0.2 to a fraction with a denominator of 10, we get 2/10.

Now, we can add the fractions: 6/10 + 2/10 = 8/10.

To find out how much each candy bar costs, we need to subtract the cost of the soft drink from the total amount Benny spent and then divide the remaining amount by the number of candy bars.

Let's assume the cost of each candy bar is represented by 'x'.

Benny spent a total of 27 dollars, which includes the cost of the soft drink and the candy bars. So, we can set up the equation:

2 + 5x = 27

To isolate 'x', we need to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

5x = 27 - 2
5x = 25

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for 'x':

x = 25/5

To find out how much more the piece of iron weighed than the piece of aluminum, we need to subtract the weight of the aluminum from the weight of the iron.

Weight of iron = 11.166666666666666 pounds
Weight of aluminum = 0.8333333333333334 pounds

To subtract these two weights, we can write it as a subtraction problem:

11.166666666666666 - 0.8333333333333334

When we subtract these two numbers, we get:

11.166666666666666 - 0.8333333333333334 = 10.333333333333333

Sandy has 8 times more blue marbles than Melanie, so we can calculate it as follows:

Number of blue marbles Sandy has = 8 * Number of blue marbles Melanie has

Number of blue marbles Sandy has = 8 * 84

Number of blue marbles Sandy has = 672

Now, to find out how many dozen blue marbles Sandy has, we divide the total number of blue marbles by 12 (since there are 12 marbles in a dozen).

Number of dozen blue marbles Sandy has = Number of blue marbles Sandy has / 12

Number of dozen blue marbles Sandy has = 672 / 12

Number of dozen blue marbles Sandy has = 56

Therefore, Sandy has 56 dozen blue marbles.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is56.

When Joan was visited by the toothfairy, she received 14 each of quarters, half-dollars, and dimes. How much money did the toothfairy leave Joan?
To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Joan, we need to calculate the total value of the quarters, half-dollars, and dimes she received.

Let's start by determining the value of the quarters. Since Joan received 14 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can multiply the number of quarters by their value:

Value of quarters = 14 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $3.50

Next, let's calculate the value of the half-dollars. Joan received 14 half-dollars, and each half-dollar is worth $0.50:

Value of half-dollars = 14 half-dollars * $0.50/half-dollar = $7.00

Finally, let's determine the value of the dimes. Joan received 14 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10:

Value of dimes = 14 dimes * $0.10/dime = $1.40

To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Joan, we add up the values of the quarters, half-dollars, and dimes:

Total value = Value of quarters + Value of half-dollars + Value of dimes
Total value = $3.50 + $7.00 + $1.40 = $12.90

Therefore, the tooth fairy left Joan a total of $12.90.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple equation. Let's assume that the number of marbles Connie initially had is represented by "x".

According to the problem, Connie gave 183 marbles to Juan, so she would have x - 183 marbles left.

We are also given that Connie has 593 marbles left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 183 = 593

To find the value of x, we can add 183 to both sides of the equation:

x - 183 + 183 = 593 + 183

This simplifies to:

x = 776

Therefore, Connie initially had 776 marbles.

Total combined pounds of fresh and frozen fruit = 9,792 pounds
Pounds of frozen fruit sold = 3,513 pounds

To find the pounds of fresh fruit sold, we subtract the pounds of frozen fruit sold from the total combined pounds:

Pounds of fresh fruit sold = Total combined pounds - Pounds of frozen fruit sold
Pounds of fresh fruit sold = 9,792 pounds - 3,513 pounds
Pounds of fresh fruit sold = 6,279 pounds

Sandy went to the mall on Saturday to buy clothes. She paid $9.24 on pants and $8.25 on a shirt with a $20 bill. How much money did Sandy get in change?
To find out how much change Sandy received, we need to subtract the total cost of her purchases from the amount she paid with the $20 bill.

The total cost of her purchases is the sum of the cost of pants and the cost of the shirt:
$9.24 (pants) + $8.25 (shirt) = $17.49

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
$20 (amount paid) - $17.49 (total cost) = $2.51

Therefore, Sandy received $2.51 in change.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is$2.51.

Lizette has 813 stamps. Lizette has 125 more stamps than Minerva. How many stamps does Minerva have?
To find out how many stamps Minerva has, we can subtract the additional 125 stamps that Lizette has from the total number of stamps Lizette has.

Let's denote the number of stamps Minerva has as M.

We know that Lizette has 813 stamps, which is 125 more than Minerva's stamps. So we can set up the equation:

813 = M + 125

To solve for M, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 125 from both sides:

813 - 125 = M + 125 - 125

688 = M

Therefore, Minerva has 688 stamps.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is688.

During a canned food drive, items were sorted into bins. The drive resulted in 0.125 of a bin of soup, 0.125 of a bin of vegetables, and 0.5 of a bin of pasta. Altogether, how many bins would the canned food take up?
To find the total number of bins the canned food would take up, we need to add up the fractions representing each type of food.

0.125 bin of soup + 0.125 bin of vegetables + 0.5 bin of pasta

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 8.

0.125 bin of soup = 1/8 bin of soup (since 0.125 is equivalent to 1/8)
0.125 bin of vegetables = 1/8 bin of vegetables
0.5 bin of pasta = 4/8 bin of pasta (since 0.5 is equivalent to 4/8)

Now, we can add the fractions:

1/8 bin of soup + 1/8 bin of vegetables + 4/8 bin of pasta

Adding the numerators together, we get:

1 + 1 + 4 = 6

So, the total number of bins the canned food would take up is 6/8 or 3/4 of a bin.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isThe total number of bins the canned food would take up is 3/4 of a bin.

On Monday, 375 students went on a trip to the zoo. All 7 buses were filled and 4 students had to travel in cars. How many students were in each bus ?
To find out how many students were in each bus, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of buses. 

First, let's calculate the total number of students on the buses. Since each bus was filled, we can multiply the number of buses (7) by the maximum capacity of each bus. 

7 buses × maximum capacity = 7 × maximum capacity

Now, we know that 4 students had to travel in cars, so we subtract them from the total number of students on the buses.

Total number of students on the buses = 375 - 4

Finally, we can divide the total number of students on the buses by the number of buses to find out how many students were in each bus.

Number of students in each bus = (375 - 4) ÷ 7

Now, let's calculate it:

Number of students in each bus = 371 ÷ 7
Number of students in each bus = 53

Therefore, there were 53 students in each bus.

Then she walked 0.1111111111111111 of a mile from the postcard shop to a T-shirt shop and 0.6666666666666666 of a mile from the T-shirt shop back to the hotel. How many miles did Trisha walk in all?
To find out how many miles Trisha walked in total, we need to add up the distances she walked. Let's calculate it step by step:

Distance from the hotel to the postcard shop: 0.1111111111111111 miles
Distance from the postcard shop to the T-shirt shop: 0.1111111111111111 miles
Distance from the T-shirt shop back to the hotel: 0.6666666666666666 miles

To find the total distance, we add these three distances together:

0.1111111111111111 + 0.1111111111111111 + 0.6666666666666666 = 0.8888888888888888 miles

Therefore, Trisha walked a total of 0.8888888888888888 miles during her vacation in New York City.

After eating at the restaurant, Sally, Sam, and Alyssa decided to divide the bill evenly. If each person paid 45 dollars, what was the total of the bill ?
To find the total bill, we need to determine the combined amount that Sally, Sam, and Alyssa paid. Since each person paid $45, we can multiply this amount by the number of people to get the total bill.

Let's assume there were 'n' people in total. Since each person paid $45, the total bill can be calculated as:

Total Bill = $45 x n

However, in this case, we know that there were three people: Sally, Sam, and Alyssa. So, substituting 'n' with 3, we can find the total bill:

Total Bill = $45 x 3
Total Bill = $135

Therefore, the total bill was $135.

Tim got 3 nickels and 13 dimes for shining shoes, and in his tip jar found 7 dimes and 9 half-dollars. How much money did Tim get?
To find out how much money Tim got, we need to add up the value of all the coins he received.

Let's start with the nickels. Tim got 3 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents. So, the total value of the nickels is 3 * 5 = 15 cents.

Next, let's consider the dimes. Tim received 13 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, the total value of the dimes is 13 * 10 = 130 cents.

Moving on to the additional coins in Tim's tip jar, he found 7 dimes, which is 7 * 10 = 70 cents.

Lastly, Tim also found 9 half-dollars. Each half-dollar is worth 50 cents, so the total value of the half-dollars is 9 * 50 = 450 cents.

Now, let's add up all the values to find the total amount of money Tim received:

15 cents (nickels) + 130 cents (dimes) + 70 cents (additional dimes) + 450 cents (half-dollars) = 665 cents.

Therefore, Tim received a total of 665 cents or $6.65.

Nicole found an orange caterpillar and a green caterpillar in her backyard. The green caterpillar was 3 inches long and the orange caterpillar was 1.1666666666666667 inches long. How much longer was the green caterpillar than the orange caterpillar?
To find out how much longer the green caterpillar is than the orange caterpillar, we need to subtract the length of the orange caterpillar from the length of the green caterpillar.

Length of green caterpillar: 3 inches
Length of orange caterpillar: 1.1666666666666667 inches

To subtract these lengths, we can write it as a subtraction problem:

3 inches - 1.1666666666666667 inches

To make the subtraction easier, we can align the decimal points:

3.0000000000000000 inches
- 1.1666666666666667 inches

Now, subtract each digit starting from the right:

0 - 7 (Since 0 is smaller than 7, we need to borrow from the digit to the left.)
10 - 7 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3

9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3
9 - 6 = 3

So, the difference between the lengths of the green caterpillar and the orange caterpillar is approximately 1.8333333333333333 inches.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1.8333333333333333 inches.

Fred has 110 blue marbles. Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim. How many blue marbles does Tim have?
To find out how many blue marbles Tim has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume Tim has x blue marbles.

According to the problem, Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim. This means that Fred has 22x blue marbles.

We also know that Fred has a total of 110 blue marbles. So, we can set up the equation:

22x = 110

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 22:

x = 110/22

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = 5

Therefore, Tim has 5 blue marbles.

To find out how many marbles Carla started with, we can subtract the number of marbles she bought from the total number of marbles she currently has.

Let's denote the number of marbles Carla started with as "x."

We know that Carla bought 489 marbles, so we can subtract this from the total number of marbles she currently has:

x + 489 = 2778

To isolate x, we need to subtract 489 from both sides of the equation:

x = 2778 - 489

Calculating this, we find:

x = 2289

Therefore, Carla started with 2289 marbles.

We know that Sean has 95 more whistles than Charles, so we can express this as:

C + 95 = 223

To solve for C, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 95 from both sides:

C + 95 - 95 = 223 - 95

This simplifies to:

C = 128

Therefore, Charles has 128 whistles.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isCharles has 128 whistles.

Mary earns $46 cleaning a home. How many homes did she clean, if she made 276 dollars?
To find out how many homes Mary cleaned, we can set up an equation. Let's assume the number of homes she cleaned is represented by 'x'. 

Since Mary earns $46 per home, the total amount she earned can be calculated by multiplying the number of homes (x) by the amount earned per home ($46). This can be expressed as:

Total earnings = Number of homes * Earnings per home
276 = 46x

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 46:

276/46 = x
6 = x

Therefore, Mary cleaned 6 homes to earn a total of $276.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is6.

Mrs. Hilt spent 74 cents at the school store. She bought a notebook for 35 cents, a ruler for 18 cents, and 3 pencils. What is the cost of one pencil?
To find the cost of one pencil, we need to subtract the cost of the notebook and ruler from the total amount spent.

Total amount spent = Cost of notebook + Cost of ruler + Cost of pencils

Given:
Total amount spent = 74 cents
Cost of notebook = 35 cents
Cost of ruler = 18 cents

Let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
Cost of pencils = Total amount spent - Cost of notebook - Cost of ruler
Cost of pencils = 74 cents - 35 cents - 18 cents
Cost of pencils = 21 cents

Since Mrs. Hilt bought 3 pencils, we can divide the total cost of pencils by the number of pencils to find the cost of one pencil:

Cost of one pencil = Cost of pencils / Number of pencils
Cost of one pencil = 21 cents / 3 pencils
Cost of one pencil = 7 cents

Therefore, the cost of one pencil is 7 cents.

Tony planted a 4 foot tree. The tree grows at a rate of 5 feet every year. How many years will it take to be 29 feet?
To find out how many years it will take for the tree to grow to 29 feet, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of years as 'x'.

Since the tree grows at a rate of 5 feet per year, we can express its height after 'x' years as 4 + 5x.

We want to find the value of 'x' when the tree's height is 29 feet. So we can set up the equation:

4 + 5x = 29

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's subtract 4 from both sides:

5x = 29 - 4
5x = 25

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25/5
x = 5

Therefore, it will take 5 years for the tree to grow to a height of 29 feet.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is5.

To find out how much more money Dalton needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the jump rope, the board game, and the playground ball, and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The cost of the jump rope is $7, the board game is $12, and the playground ball is $4. To find the total cost, we add these amounts together:

$7 + $12 + $4 = $23

So, the total cost of the jump rope, the board game, and the playground ball is $23.

Now, let's calculate how much money Dalton already has. He saved $6 from his allowance, and his uncle gave him $13. Adding these amounts together:

$6 + $13 = $19

Therefore, Dalton already has $19.

To find out how much more money Dalton needs, we subtract the amount he already has from the total cost:

0.20 of a number decreased by 4 is equal to 6. Find the number.
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number we're trying to find is represented by "x".

The problem states that 0.20 of the number decreased by 4 is equal to 6. Mathematically, we can represent this as:

0.20x - 4 = 6

To find the value of "x", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's add 4 to both sides of the equation:

0.20x - 4 + 4 = 6 + 4

Simplifying, we get:

0.20x = 10

Now, to solve for "x", we need to get rid of the decimal. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 10:

10 * 0.20x = 10 * 10

Simplifying further:

2x = 100

Finally, to find the value of "x", we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x/2 = 100/2

This gives us:

x = 50

Therefore, the number we were looking for is 50.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is50.

Alyssa's dog had puppies. She gave 7 to her friends.  She now has 5 puppies left. How many puppies did she have to start with ?
To find out how many puppies Alyssa had to start with, we can work backwards from the information given. 

If Alyssa gave 7 puppies to her friends and now has 5 puppies left, we can add the number of puppies she gave away to the number she currently has to find the total number of puppies she started with.

Let's denote the number of puppies Alyssa started with as "x". 

Given that she gave away 7 puppies, we can subtract this from the total number of puppies she started with: x - 7.

Since she now has 5 puppies left, we can set up the equation: x - 7 = 5.

To solve for x, we can add 7 to both sides of the equation: x - 7 + 7 = 5 + 7.

This simplifies to: x = 12.

Therefore, Alyssa started with 12 puppies.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) isAlyssa started with 12 puppies.

To find out how many more cans of cat food Adam bought compared to dog food, we need to calculate the total number of cans for each type of food and then find the difference.

The number of cans of cat food can be calculated by multiplying the number of packages of cat food (9) by the number of cans per package (10):
9 packages * 10 cans/package = 90 cans of cat food.

Similarly, the number of cans of dog food can be calculated by multiplying the number of packages of dog food (7) by the number of cans per package (5):
7 packages * 5 cans/package = 35 cans of dog food.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of cans of dog food from the number of cans of cat food:
90 cans of cat food - 35 cans of dog food = 55 more cans of cat food.
