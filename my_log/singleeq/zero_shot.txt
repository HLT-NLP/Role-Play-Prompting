The value of a sport utility vehicle this year is 16,000 dollars , which is 0.8 of what its value was last year. How much is the value of the vehicle last year?
Let's assume the value of the vehicle last year is V.
According to the given information, 0.8V = 16,000 dollars.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.8, we get V = 16,000 / 0.8 = 20,000 dollars.

Oceanside Bike Rental Shop charges 17 dollars plus 7 dollars an hour for renting a bike. Tom paid 80 dollars to rent a bike. How many hours did he pay to have the bike checked out ?
Let's assume Tom rented the bike for x hours.
The cost of renting the bike for x hours is 7x dollars.
The total cost of renting the bike is 17 + 7x dollars.
Since Tom paid 80 dollars, we can set up the equation 17 + 7x = 80.

Given that the world grain supply is 1,800,000 metric tons and the supply ratio is 0.75, we can substitute these values into the equation:

World grain demand = 1,800,000 / 0.75

For his long distance phone service Milan pays a 2 dollars monthly fee plus 12 cents per minute. Last month , Milan 's long distance bill was 23.36 dollars. For how many minutes was Milan billed for ?
Let's assume Milan was billed for x minutes.
The total cost for the minutes is 12x cents.
Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, the total cost for the minutes is 12x/100 dollars.
The total bill is the sum of the monthly fee and the cost for the minutes, so it is 2 + 12x/100 dollars.
We know that the total bill is 23.36 dollars, so we can write the equation 2 + 12x/100 = 23.36.
Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get 12x/100 = 21.36.
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100, we get 12x = 2136.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 12, we get x = 178.
Milan was billed for 178 minutes. Answer: \boxed{178}.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is178.

Purple ring weight = 0.3333333333333333 ounce
White ring weight = 0.4166666666666667 ounce

Total weight = 0.08333333333333333 + 0.3333333333333333 + 0.4166666666666667
Total weight = 0.8333333333333333 ounce

Therefore, the total weight of the plastic rings is 0.8333333333333333 ounce.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is0.8333333333333333

The sum of three consecutive odd numbers is 69. What is the smallest of the three numbers ?

According to the problem, the sum of these three numbers is 69:

x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 69

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 6 = 69

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we have:

3x = 63

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

x = 21

A DVD book holds 126 DVDs. There are 81 DVDs already in the book. How many more DVDs can be put in the book?
To find out how many more DVDs can be put in the book, we need to subtract the number of DVDs already in the book from the total capacity of the book.

Total capacity of the book = 126 DVDs
Number of DVDs already in the book = 81 DVDs

Number of DVDs that can be put in the book = Total capacity of the book - Number of DVDs already in the book
Number of DVDs that can be put in the book = 126 DVDs - 81 DVDs
Number of DVDs that can be put in the book = 45 DVDs

Therefore, 45 more DVDs can be put in the book.

Let x be the number of cards Benny started with.
After his dog ate half of his collection, Benny had x/2 cards left.
After buying 4 new cards, Benny had x/2 + 4 = 34 cards left.
Combining like terms, we get x/2 + 4 = 34

Betty also bought 140 shiny blue round stones. If 14 pieces of this stone is in each bracelet, how many bracelets of blue shiny round stones will there be?
To find the number of bracelets, we need to divide the total number of stones by the number of stones in each bracelet.

Number of stones = 140
Number of stones in each bracelet = 14

Number of bracelets = Number of stones / Number of stones in each bracelet
Number of bracelets = 140 / 14
Number of bracelets = 10

Therefore, there will be 10 bracelets of blue shiny round stones.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is10.

The total number of stamps that Lizette and Minerva have is x+(x+125)=813
Combining like terms, we get 2x+125=813

A mechanic charged 45 dollars an hour , plus 225 dollars for the parts. If the total bill was 450 dollars , how many hours did the job take?
Let's assume the number of hours the job took is x.
The cost for the labor is 45x dollars.
The total bill is the sum of the cost for the labor and the cost for the parts, which is 45x + 225 dollars.
Since the total bill is 450 dollars, we can set up the equation 45x + 225 = 450.
Subtracting 225 from both sides of the equation, we get 45x = 225.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 45, we get x = 5.

The sum of three consecutive even numbers is 162. What is the smallest of the three numbers ?
Let's call the smallest of the three consecutive even numbers x. The next even number would be x + 2, and the one after that would be x + 4.

The sum of these three numbers is x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 3x + 6.

We know that the sum of the three numbers is 162, so we can set up the equation 3x + 6 = 162.

Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get 3x = 156.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get x = 52.

To find the total distance Trisha walked, we need to add up the distances she walked from the hotel to the postcard shop, from the postcard shop to the T-shirt shop, and from the T-shirt shop back to the hotel.

To find the total number of feathers needed for 934 crowns, we need to multiply the number of crowns by the number of feathers per crown.

Number of feathers per crown = 7

Number of crowns = 934

Total number of feathers needed = Number of feathers per crown * Number of crowns

Total number of feathers needed = 7 * 934

Total number of feathers needed = 6538

Therefore, 6538 feathers are needed for 934 crowns.

0.20 of a number decreased by 4 is equal to 6. Find the number.
Let's represent the number as "x".

The equation can be written as:

0.20x - 4 = 6

To solve for x, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation:

0.20x = 10

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.20 to isolate x:

x = 10 / 0.20

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

x = 50

Therefore, the number is 50.

A truck carrying 4.1 pounds of sand travels to a construction yard and loses 2.4 pounds of sand along the way. How much sand does the truck have when it arrives at the yard?
To find out how much sand the truck has when it arrives at the yard, we need to subtract the amount of sand it lost from the amount it started with.

Starting amount of sand: 4.1 pounds
Amount of sand lost: 2.4 pounds

Sand remaining = Starting amount - Amount lost
Sand remaining = 4.1 pounds - 2.4 pounds
Sand remaining = 1.7 pounds

Therefore, the truck has 1.7 pounds of sand when it arrives at the yard.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is1.7
