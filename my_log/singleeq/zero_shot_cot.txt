The value of a sport utility vehicle this year is 16,000 dollars , which is 0.8 of what its value was last year. How much is the value of the vehicle last year?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume the value of the vehicle last year is "x" dollars.
Step 2: According to the problem, the value of the vehicle this year is 0.8 times the value of the vehicle last year. So, we can write this as an equation: 0.8x = 16,000.
Step 3: To find the value of the vehicle last year, we need to solve this equation for x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.8: x = 16,000 / 0.8.
Step 4: Evaluating the right side of the equation, we find that x = 20,000.
Therefore, the value of the vehicle last year was 20,000 dollars.

Step 4: So, the total cost of renting the bike for x hours is 7x + 17 dollars.

Step 5: According to the problem, Tom paid 80 dollars to rent the bike.

Step 6: Therefore, we can set up the equation 7x + 17 = 80.

Step 7: Now, let's solve the equation for x.

7x + 17 = 80
Subtract 17 from both sides:
7x = 63
Divide both sides by 7:
x = 9

Step 8: The value of x is 9, which means Tom rented the bike for 9 hours.

So, Tom paid to have the bike checked out for 9 hours.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is9.

Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Calculate the total distance Craig traveled.
To find the total distance Craig traveled, we need to add the distance he rode on the bus to the distance he walked. 

Distance rode on the bus = 3.8333333333333335 miles
Distance walked = 0.16666666666666666 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance rode on the bus + Distance walked
Total distance traveled = 3.8333333333333335 miles + 0.16666666666666666 miles
Total distance traveled = 4 miles

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the distance Craig rode and the distance he walked.
To find the difference between the distance Craig rode and the distance he walked, we need to subtract the distance he walked from the distance he rode on the bus.

Difference = Distance rode on the bus - Distance walked
Difference = 3.8333333333333335 miles - 0.16666666666666666 miles
Difference = 3.666666666666667 miles

Let's think step by step.
To find the total amount of material ordered, we need to add the amounts of concrete, bricks, and stone together.

The company ordered 0.16666666666666666 of a ton of concrete.
The company ordered 0.16666666666666666 of a ton of bricks.
The company ordered 0.5 of a ton of stone.

To add these fractions together, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 6.

0.16666666666666666 of a ton of concrete is equivalent to 1/6 of a ton.
0.16666666666666666 of a ton of bricks is equivalent to 1/6 of a ton.
0.5 of a ton of stone is equivalent to 3/6 of a ton.

Now we can add the fractions together:

1/6 + 1/6 + 3/6 = 5/6

So the company ordered a total of 5/6 of a ton of material.

Trenton sells electronic supplies. Each week he earns 190 dollars plus commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. This week his goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. How much sales  he must make to reach his goal?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine how much commission Trenton earns based on his sales. We can do this by multiplying his sales by 0.04: commission = sales * 0.04.

Next, we need to determine how much Trenton earns in total, including his base salary and commission. We can do this by adding his base salary to his commission: total earnings = base salary + commission.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent Trenton's goal of earning no less than 500 dollars: total earnings ≥ 500.

Substituting the expressions for total earnings and commission into the equation, we get: base salary + commission ≥ 500.

Since we know Trenton's base salary is 190 dollars, we can substitute that into the equation: 190 + commission ≥ 500.

Now, we can solve for the commission by subtracting 190 from both sides of the equation: commission ≥ 500 - 190.

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get: commission ≥ 310.

Therefore, Trenton must make at least 310 dollars in sales to reach his goal.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is310.

Freeport McMoran projects the world grain supply will be 1800000 metric tons and the supply will be only 0.75 of the world grain demand. What will the world grain demand be?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume the world grain demand is represented by D.

Step 2: According to the information given, the supply will be only 0.75 of the world grain demand. This can be represented as 0.75D.

Step 3: The problem states that the supply will be 1,800,000 metric tons. So, we can set up the equation: 0.75D = 1,800,000.

Step 4: To find the value of D, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75: D = 1,800,000 / 0.75.

Step 5: Evaluating the right side of the equation, we find that D = 2,400,000 metric tons.

Therefore, the world grain demand will be 2,400,000 metric tons.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is2,400,000.

For his long distance phone service Milan pays a 2 dollars monthly fee plus 12 cents per minute. Last month , Milan 's long distance bill was 23.36 dollars. For how many minutes was Milan billed for ?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume that Milan was billed for x minutes.

Step 2: Milan pays a monthly fee of $2, which is a fixed cost and does not depend on the number of minutes.

Step 3: Milan also pays 12 cents per minute, which is a variable cost that depends on the number of minutes.

Step 4: The total cost of Milan's long distance bill can be calculated using the formula: Total cost = Monthly fee + (Cost per minute * Number of minutes)

Step 5: We can substitute the given values into the formula: 23.36 = 2 + (0.12 * x)

Step 6: Simplifying the equation, we get: 23.36 - 2 = 0.12x

Step 7: Solving for x, we get: 21.36 = 0.12x

Step 8: Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.12, we get: x = 21.36 / 0.12

Step 9: Calculating the value of x, we get: x ≈ 178

Therefore, Milan was billed for approximately 178 minutes.

Lizette has 813 stamps. Lizette has 125 more stamps than Minerva. How many stamps does Minerva have?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Let's assume the number of stamps Minerva has as "x".

Step 2: According to the problem, Lizette has 125 more stamps than Minerva. So, Lizette has x + 125 stamps.

Step 3: The total number of stamps Lizette and Minerva have is 813. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 125) = 813

Step 4: Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 125 = 813

Step 5: Subtracting 125 from both sides of the equation, we get:

2x = 688

A mechanic charged 45 dollars an hour , plus 225 dollars for the parts. If the total bill was 450 dollars , how many hours did the job take?
Let's think step by step.
Let's assume the number of hours the job took is "x".

The mechanic charges $45 per hour, so the cost for labor would be 45x dollars.

The cost for parts is given as $225.

The total bill is given as $450.

So, the equation becomes: 45x + 225 = 450.

Now, let's solve for x.

Subtracting 225 from both sides of the equation, we get: 45x = 450 - 225.

Simplifying the right side, we get: 45x = 225.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 45, we get: x = 225 / 45.

Simplifying the right side, we get: x = 5.

Therefore, the job took 5 hours.

On Monday, 375 students went on a trip to the zoo. All 7 buses were filled and 4 students had to travel in cars. How many students were in each bus ?
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Find the total number of students who traveled by bus.
Since there were 7 buses and each bus was filled, the total number of students who traveled by bus is 7 * (number of students in each bus).

Step 2: Find the total number of students who traveled by car.
Since 4 students had to travel in cars, the total number of students who traveled by car is 4.

Step 3: Find the total number of students who went on the trip.
The total number of students who went on the trip is the sum of the number of students who traveled by bus and the number of students who traveled by car.

Step 4: Divide the total number of students who went on the trip by the number of buses to find the number of students in each bus.
The number of students in each bus is the total number of students who went on the trip divided by the number of buses.

Let's calculate the answer using these steps:
Step 1: 7 * (number of students in each bus) = total number of students who traveled by bus
Step 2: 4 = total number of students who traveled by car
Step 3: total number of students who went on the trip = total number of students who traveled by bus + total number of students who traveled by car
Step 4: number of students in each bus = total number of students who went on the trip / number of buses

We are given that the total number of students who went on the trip is 375 and the number of buses is 7.

Step 1: 7 * (number of students in each bus) = total number of students who traveled by bus
7 * (number of students in each bus) = 375 - 4
7 * (number of students in each bus) = 371

Step 4: number of students in each bus = total number of students who went on the trip / number of buses
(number of students in each bus) = 371 / 7
(number of students in each bus) = 53

Therefore, there were 53 students in each bus.

Let's think step by step.
To find the total amount of snow Logan recorded, we need to add up the measurements from each day.

On Wednesday, Logan recorded 0.3333333333333333 of a centimeter.
On Thursday, Logan recorded 0.3333333333333333 of a centimeter.
On Friday, Logan recorded 0.2222222222222222 of a centimeter.

To add these fractions together, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 3.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 3:
0.3333333333333333 = 1/3
0.3333333333333333 = 1/3
0.2222222222222222 = 2/9

Now we can add the fractions together:
1/3 + 1/3 + 2/9

To add fractions, we need to have a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 9.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 9:
1/3 = 3/9
1/3 = 3/9
2/9 = 2/9

Now we can add the fractions together:
3/9 + 3/9 + 2/9 = 8/9

So Logan recorded a total of 8/9 centimeters of snow.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is8/9

The sum of three consecutive even numbers is 162. What is the smallest of the three numbers ?
Let's think step by step.
Let's represent the three consecutive even numbers as x, x+2, and x+4. 

According to the problem, the sum of these three numbers is 162. 

So, we can write the equation: x + (x+2) + (x+4) = 162. 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 6 = 162. 

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we have: 3x = 156. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 52. 

Therefore, the smallest of the three numbers is 52.

Tim got 3 nickels and 13 dimes for shining shoes, and in his tip jar found 7 dimes and 9 half-dollars. How much money did Tim get?
Let's think step by step.
First, let's calculate the total amount of money Tim got from the nickels. Since he got 3 nickels, and each nickel is worth $0.05, the total amount of money from the nickels is 3 * $0.05 = $<<3*0.05=0.15>>0.15.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Tim got from the dimes. He got 13 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10, so the total amount of money from the dimes is 13 * $0.10 = $<<13*0.10=1.30>>1.30.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Tim found in his tip jar. He found 7 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10, so the total amount of money from the dimes in the tip jar is 7 * $0.10 = $<<7*0.10=0.70>>0.70.
He also found 9 half-dollars, and each half-dollar is worth $0.50, so the total amount of money from the half-dollars in the tip jar is 9 * $0.50 = $<<9*0.50=4.50>>4.50.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money Tim got. The total amount of money from the nickels and dimes is $0.15 + $1.30 = $<<0.15+1.30=1.45>>1.45.
The total amount of money from the dimes and half-dollars in the tip jar is $0.70 + $4.50 = $<<0.70+4.50=5.20>>5.20.
Therefore, the total amount of money Tim got is $1.45 + $5.20 = $<<1.45+5.20=6.65>>6.65. Answer: \boxed{6.65}.

Step 2: Simplify the difference in length.
The difference in length is 1.8333333333333333 inches.

Step 3: Round the difference in length to a reasonable decimal place.
Rounding to two decimal places, the difference in length is approximately 1.83 inches.

Sean has 223 whistles. Sean has 95 more whistles than Charles. How many whistles does Charles have?
Let's think step by step.
Let's assume Charles has x whistles.
According to the information given, Sean has 95 more whistles than Charles, so Sean has x + 95 whistles.
We also know that Sean has 223 whistles, so we can set up the equation x + 95 = 223.
To solve for x, we subtract 95 from both sides of the equation: x = 223 - 95.
Simplifying the equation, we find that x = 128.
Therefore, Charles has 128 whistles.
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is128.

Mrs. Hilt spent 74 cents at the school store. She bought a notebook for 35 cents, a ruler for 18 cents, and 3 pencils. What is the cost of one pencil?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the total cost of the notebook, ruler, and pencils. The notebook costs 35 cents and the ruler costs 18 cents, so the total cost of the notebook and ruler is 35 + 18 = <<35+18=53>>53 cents.
Next, we need to find the cost of the pencils. We know that the total cost of all the items is 74 cents, and the cost of the notebook and ruler is 53 cents. Therefore, the cost of the pencils is 74 - 53 = <<74-53=21>>21 cents.
Since Mrs. Hilt bought 3 pencils, we can divide the total cost of the pencils by the number of pencils to find the cost of one pencil. Therefore, the cost of one pencil is 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 cents. Answer: \boxed{7}.
